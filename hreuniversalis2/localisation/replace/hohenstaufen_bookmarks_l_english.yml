 THE_GREAT_SCHISM: "The Great Schism"
 THE_GREAT_SCHISM_DESC: "The 'Great' or 'East-West' schism was a gradual alienation between the Byzantine church and the Western rite loyal to the Papacy. While it entailed centuries of cultural and doctrinal divergences such as the Filioque controversy, July 16th 1054 marked the unprecedented mutual excommunucation of Papal legates and Patriarch Kiroularios. Though the incident was soon rectified, a division in Christianity was becoming increasingly undeniable.		\n \n§G1054 is simply an early bound on start dates and is not meant to be a 'default'.

 THE_FIRST_CRUSADE: "The First Crusade"
 THE_FIRST_CRUSADE_DESC: "After the failed mass-movement of Peter the Hermit, a well-disciplined alliance of French Princes brought their retinues down to Anatolia and scored a string of successes against the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm, virtually collapsing its authority. With the Levantine coast in chaos due to Islamic infighting, the 'Crusaders', under their de-facto leader Godfrey of Bouillon, now set their sight on recapturing the most holy city in Christendom - Jerusalem."
#1187
 BATTLE_OF_HATTIN: "The Battle of Hattin"
 BATTLE_OF_HATTIN_DESC: "The disastrous Battle of Hattin saw Saladin's forces route a grand Crusader army in reaction to hostilities from Raynald of Châtillon. Raynald was executed, King Guy of Jerusalem was captured, and Jerusalem's flanks now lay open for total Egyptian conquest. \n \nNews of the loss would spread fast, however, and within a few months two of the greatest monarchs of Europe would start planning another Crusade to defeat Saladin and liberate the Holy Kingdom's lost lands..."

 LATIN_EMPIRE_START: "The Latin Empire"
 LATIN_EMPIRE_START_DESC: "The notorious and ill-fated Fourth Crusade, which was supposed to retake Jerusalem after an invasion through Egypt, was instead derailed by scheming Venetians, corrupt leaders, and the deposed Byzantine Emperor Alexios IV who sought to regain his lost throne. The result was the tragic sack of Constantinople and the subsequent establishment of the so-called Latin Empire. Almost none of the Crusaders even reached the Holy Land.	 \n \nMeanwhile, the infamous King John, brother of Richard the Lionheart, rules in England, and the Christian states of Spain face off against the powerful Almohad dynasty."
#1248
 DEATH_OF_CONRAD: "The Battle of Parma"
 DEATH_OF_CONRAD_DESC: "On the 18th of February 1248 the Guelph forces of the Lombard League attacked the Ghibelline camp outside Parma while Emperor Friedrich II was off hunting, routing his army completely and capturing the Crown Jewels. Though Friedrich began to amass a new army in Southern Italy, the defeat inspired many more Italian states to take up arms against him, cementing the decline of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. \n \nIn the east, the more successful emperor Ioannes Batatzes of Nikaia is poised to deliver more crippling blows to Bulgaria and eventually retake the holy Byzantine capital."
#1309
 THE_BABYLONIAN_CAPTIVITY: "Babylonian Captivity"
 THE_BABYLONIAN_CAPTIVITY_DESC: "March 1309 marked the movement of the Curia under Pope Clemens V to Avignon, where subsequent Popes would reside for 67 years. The Papal proximity to the Kingdom of France allowed Philippe IV and his successors to exert considerable influence over Catholic affairs, leading the period to be laballed 'The Babylonian Captivity' after an ancient Biblical story.   \n \nHeinrich VII had recently secured the Royal German election and would soon by crowned Holy Roman Emperor after decades of Interregnum, establishing the House of Luxemburg as a powerful Imperial dynasty."

 HYW_START: "Hundred Years War"
 HYW_START_DESC: "The death of French King Charles IV in 1328 with no immediate heir triggered a succession dispute that would last for over a hundred years. Edward III of England was the closest living male heir, but the French nobility, balking at the prospect of a foreign king, claimed the line could not pass through a woman, and crowned another pretender - Philippe. Nine years later, war broke out..."
#1356
 THE_GOLDEN_BULL: "The Golden Bull"
 THE_GOLDEN_BULL_DESC: "At the Diet of Metz, one of the most important decrees in the history of the Holy Roman Empire was issued by Emperor Karl IV. The so-called Golden Bull firmly established the Empire's electoral system by elevating seven princes to theoretically permanent privileges: Mainz, Cologne, Trier, Bohemia, Brandenburg, Saxony, and the Palatinate."

 IN_NOMINE_START: "In Nomine"
 IN_NOMINE_START_DESC: "The year is 1399 and there is turmoil everywhere. The Hundred Years War rages on in France, while the Byzantine Empire clings to just a few enclaves across thousands of miles of Islamic land. However, amongst all the chaos, scholars in Italy have effected a reinvigoration of ancient knowledge which may develop into a full-fledged paradigm shift in Western thought. Glory is there for those who can seize the opportunity..."

 SEVEN_YEARS_WAR_DESC: "The Seven Years' War was one the largest conflicts of its time. Concerning mainly Prussia and Austria in the beginning, but soon enough engaging both France and Russia on the Austrian side and Great Britain on the Prussian."
 string_start_tag_europe: "Europe in [GetYear] is on the verge of the §YAge of Discovery§!, yet it is reeling from the shock of the failed Crusade of Varna, as well as the threat of the §YOttoman§! Empire in the east.\n\nThe Treaty of Tours has left Western Europe with an uneasy truce, one that looks like it could break at any time, due to the ambition of the Kings of §YFrance§!, §YEngland§!, or the Duke of §YBurgundy§!.\n\nIn the north, the Kalmar Union remains in place, despite the deposition of its Pommeranian king by the Hanseatic League, as well as dissident §YSwedish§! and §YDanish§! nobles.\n\nAs the High Renaissance approaches, §YItaly§! and §YGermany§! remain fraught by the constant friction between the §YEmperor§! and the many autonomous princes.\n\nThe entire continent is on the verge of major changes, and it will be up to you to lead the §Y[Root.GetAdjective]§!

 string_start_europe_description: "Europe is home to the §YHoly Roman Empire§!, a giant, but largely divided, Empire that dominates the §YGerman§! and §YNorthern Italian§! regions. Upon the death of an §YEmperor§! the §YImperial Electors§! select his replacement by voting. A member can become an Elector by being granted an Electorate by the current Emperor or inheriting an Elector.\n\nCountries within the Holy Roman Empire are allowed their own diplomacy and can even have their own subjects, but the Emperor is obligated to defend them from outside forces and can demand that rivals hand back §YUnlawfully Acquired Territory§! within the Empire.\n\nWhile the §YAuthority§! of the Emperor is currently low, this may change if the Emperor can strengthen his hold through §YImperial Reforms§!.\n\n[Root.start_imperial_cities_description]Northern Italy is also technically a part of the Holy Roman Empire, but the region has been fighting Imperial control for a long time.

 string_start_age_of_empire: "After 1054 the Christian West would be forever split into the competing religious camps of Catholicism and Orthodoxy. In a sense, this split was reflective of a general trend across the political board:\nEmpires that had stood for centuries collapsed into decentralized feudal states or entirely independent rump successors.\n\nOne of the most important developments of the era came in the mysterious isles up north, where the Anglo-Saxon §YKingdom of England§! would face simultaneous invasions from Vikings and from §YNormandy§!.\n\nThe §YSalian§! dynasty rules the §YHoly Roman Empire§!, but this could change at any moment as the semi-official electors choose a new leader."
 string_start_age_of_holy_wars: "Starting in 1095 the Western world and the Near East were shaped by a sudden fervor for Holy Wars. Though the Christians termed this foray into the Levant a 'Crusade', §YIberia§! would also become a hotbed of warfare between the Islamic Taifas and Spanish Reconquistadors.\n\nThe Pagans up north did not escape unscathed with the Wendish Crusade and rise of the §YTeutonic§! and §YLivonian§! Orders, and even Orthodox §YByzantium§! was crushed by its Catholic rivals, spelling its ultimate demise and the rise of the §YTurkish Beyliks§!.\n\nThe demands of warfare also spurred an unprecedented advancement in military technologies, especially around forts and sieging."
 string_start_age_of_crisis: "Invasions from the east spell a collapse of authority in §YPoland§!, §YHungary§!, and the §YBalkans§!. The death of the last member of the illustrious §YHohenstaufen§! dynasty will likewise plunge Central Europe into an anarchical interregnum that would last for decades, until the house of §YHabsburg§! can re-establish order.\n\n§YByzantium§! has spent much of the century defunct after the Fourth Crusade split it apart, and the §YAngevin Empire§! on the opposite side of the continent has fallen under the mismanagement of §YKing John§!."
 string_start_age_of_dynasticism: "In many ways the 14th century was defined by the Hundred Years' War between §YEngland§! and §YFrance§!, wherein the former tried to wrestle the Frankish Crown from the latter. Like the Crusades, this war saw the rise of new tactics and technologies, as well as a blossoming of chivalric culture and art.\n\nThe Black Death would also affect virtually every state of the continent, killing large swathes of the European population, peasant and king alike.\n\nIn §YAnatolia§!, the Turkish §YBeyliks§! have acheived full independence and will come to haunt their former Greek overlords and Latin crusader states alike."
 string_start_age_of_reformation: "The 16th century is a time of great changes in the political fabric of the world. The rebellion against the §YCatholic§! Church itself, by a number of §YReformers§! and their adherents, will in time have a profound impact on the political life on Europe. More immediately, however, dynamic statesmen are reshaping the world to their liking.\n\nIn Western Europe, §YFrance§!, §YSpain§! and §YAustria§! are in constant conflict over §YItaly§! and the §YLow Countries§!.\n\nThe Kalmar Union, once the defining alliance of Northern Europe, has been broken apart by §YSwedish§! noblemen, eager to build an empire of their own, rather than to serve in one ruled from Copenhagen.\n\nIn the Near East, the §YOttomans§! are about to embark on more large scale expansion than ever before in their history."
 string_start_age_of_absolutism: "Even years after the fact, few yet realize that the conflict that started by a window in Prague in 1618 will devastate the European continent for 30 years, and define the 17th century.\n\nTo the east the §YPolish-Lithuanian Commonwealth§! is losing ground, and the §YOttoman§! Empire has a firm hold over the Kingdom of §YHungary§!. While no border of the Empire is at peace, not in the Maghreb or the Balkans, the Sultanate has yet to reach its greatest extent.\n\n§YSpain§! seemingly reigns supreme in Christian Europe, but the Kingdom is about to be challenged in this region.\n\nThis is an age of Empires and rapidly growing central power, an age of war and conquest."
 string_start_age_of_revolutions: "At the dawn of the §YAge of Revolutions§! the great European Empires look as stable as ever. However, the seeds of their destruction are planted.\n\nIn Europe, the era of Absolutism has left the continent dominated by strong, hungry, and militaristic states.\nWithin a century, some of these kingdoms will spend great resources tearing each other apart, with the weaker ones, such as §YSweden§! or §YPoland§!, left by the wayside.\n\nHowever, a much greater threat will in time reveal itself from within. As the hurdled masses embrace the revolutionary ideals, no monarch, however, enlightened, will be safe."
 string_start_age_of_ideology: "The paradigm shift spurred by Napoléon would not end with his eventual demise. Revolutionary ideals and questioning of authority have reshaped the fabric of Western society, paving the way for even more violent upheavals in future decades.\n\nAt the same time, however, Europe has seen an unprecedented era of consolidation - figures like Metternich and Bismarck demonstrate that even a non-sovereign can effectively run a monarchy, and the ancient Hohenzollern dynasty of §YPrussia§! will soon make their final push to the ultimate European empire.\nTo the south, it is the Savoyards of §YSardinia-Piedmont§! who ultimately advance the project of Italian unification.\n\nIn the east, the once-fearsome §YOttoman§! Empire is crumbling to rebellions and invasions, earning it the moniker 'the sick man'."
 string_start_denmark: "As of the treaty of Kalmar in 1397 the Nordic Crowns of §YSweden§! and §YDenmark§! are intended to be borne by one monarch. Since its inception this §YKalmar Union§! has been lead by the Danes, the strongest and richest of the Nordic powers, close to the continent with an ambition to control and dominate the Baltic Sea area.\n\nThe Danish monarchy has many enemies however, in particular among the cities of the §YHanseatic League§!, an alliance of free cities in control of the Baltic trade that Denmark now threatens. This recently culminated in a series of wars ending in the loss of §YSlesvig§! followed by the deposition of the Danish king Erik, now a mere pirate chief on the island of Gotland.\n\nDenmark has just elected a new king from the Bavarian §YWittelsbach§! family. Cristopher has no ties to the Danish or Swedish nobility but it seems he has grand plans for the three Nordic kingdoms, styling himself the first Arch-King of the North.\n\nTime will tell what Christopher's legacy will be. The Danish crown has pawned away many of its assets to its leading families while the Swedish nobles do not seem to care much for their new German king. The Swedish nobility was recently united under their regent, Karl Knutsson."
 string_start_portugal: "With the Reconquista almost complete, and the Iberian peninsula almost entirely in Christian hands, the kingdom of §YPortugal§! has turned its attention to other matters.\n\nAs of [GetYear] King Afonso is still a minor, with the daily rule of the kingdom entrusted to another uncle, Don Pedro, duke of Coimbra. Don Pedro’s regency has been fraught with the difficulties of controlling the strong Portuguese nobility at court, but the duke has so far been able to ably strengthen royal power at their expense. As Afonso grows older however other forces at court will try to control him, hoping to use the young king for their own designs.\n\nWhile Castile has had a series of weak rulers and strong nobles, the Castilians can be a serious threat to the Portuguese. The royal house of Aviz has therefore pursued a policy of intermarriage with the Castilian royal family, hoping to ensure a lasting friendship and possibly strengthen future Portuguese claims to the Castilian throne."
 string_start_brandenburg: "The recent history of the March of §YBrandenburg§! has been a sad state of affairs. With poor soils, swamps and wild forests Brandenburg is not the richest lands of the §YHoly Roman Empire§! and under §YWittelsbach§! and §YLuxemburg§! rule the region has been been treated as a source of quick income. With the ascendence of the §YHohenzollern§! Dynasty things have slowly begun to change. Friedrich I spent his entire reign wearing down the influence of the Brandenburg estates and fighting the prevalent lawlessness, sending his armies against the castles of the many robber barons that have for long had a free reign over the region.\n\nIn many ways §YFriedrich II§!, ‘the Iron’, has proven to be his father’s son, resuming the policies intended to crush the power of local potentates and greedy burghers. He has also sent out feelers to the §YTeutonic Order§! for the reclamation of §YNeumark§!, a land originally part of Brandenburg, but pawned by his predecessors.\n\nThe difficulty in asserting state power is amply demonstrated by the Kalmar Union kingdoms of §YDenmark§! and §YSweden§!, were a king attempting to achieve similar goals was recently deposed and replaced by a Bavarian Wittelsbach. If Brandenburg is to be made a durable state it must also remain united, avoiding squabbles like those among the §YWettin§! heirs in Electoral §YSaxony§! to the south.\n\nThe nearby kingdoms of §YPoland§! and §YBohemia§! are both without rulers in 1444, one as a direct result of the failed Crusade of Varna against the Ottomans, and the other due to the rejection of the Habsburg heir Ladislaus the Posthumous by the Bohemian nobility. Despite the Bohemian lands still not having recovered from the Hussite wars of the last decades the Heretic Hussites remain a strong factor in Bohemian politics, making the kingdom a cause for concern among all its neighbors, Brandenburg included."
 string_start_ottomans: "The §YOttomans§! in [GetYear] are a regional power, in the process of securing control over the Balkans.\n\nIn Europe, the Ottomans have defeated the Crusaders in the Battle of Varna, killing Wladyslaw, the §YPolish§! and §YHungarian§! king. §YByzantium§! now lies exposed and §YHungary§! has been forced on the defensive, but with the fortress of §YBelgrade§!, still serves as a strong bulwark against further Ottoman expansion. The lesser princes in between can survive only by playing the great powers off one another. Further south, §YSkanderbeg§! leads the §YAlbanian§! chiefdoms in revolt against the Ottomans, supported by §YVenice§!, which still dominates the seas.\n\nThe realm ruled by the Ottoman dynasty is not yet a centralized state in [GetYear]. The sultan’s authority is enforced only by his small household of servants, recruited from slaves captured in war and from the ‘devshirme’, the periodic conscription of Christian youths from the Balkan countryside. These are the famous §YJanissaries§!, who will in time grow into a powerful standing army. The Ottomans have come to power with the military backing of numerous marcher-lords, still highly autonomous on the Balkan frontier, while the administration lies in the hands of the Turkish aristocracy, literate in the ways of statecraft, but largely independent of the sultan’s authority.\n\nAll this is about to change. Having defeated the Crusader armies, the old sultan Murad II is now on his way back to his estates in Manisa, leaving the government in the hands of the young §YMehmed II§!. It is he who will go on to transform the Ottoman state into an empire, acquiring Constantinople as an imperial capital and establishing a centralized administration to rein in the marcher-lords and old Turkish families. For 'The Grand Turk', there can be no compromise – the House of Osman is to be the supreme authority in the land. The only question is this: where will his armies turn to first?"
 string_start_tag_africa: "North Africa is going through a general crisis of de-urbanization, foreign invasions, and famine, as successive Moroccan empires rise and fall.\n\nEventually, the domineering forces of Iberia and Turkey will crush African autonomy in reaction to the dangerous power of the Moorish pirate kings."
