 pir_i1: "More Guidelines Than Rules"
 pir_i1_desc: "Privateers are great innovators when it comes to ship combat. By adopting their knowledge and tactics in our regular fleet, we will become more effective."
 pir_i2: "Just Good Business"
 pir_i2_desc: "Trade is a major part of international relations. If we apply the right kind of pressure, we might be able to influence nations to our point of view."
 pir_i3: "Stop Blowing Holes in My Ship"
 pir_i3_desc: "Ordinarily, damaged enemy ships are abandoned, but many are still serviceable. We could easily repair them and use them to grow our own fleets."
 pir_i4: "Pieces of Eight"
 pir_i4_desc: "The more loot our privateers gain, the less we have to pay them, and the more money we make."
 pir_i5: "The Triple Guns"
 pir_i5_desc: "Privateer ships are involved in more skirmishes than most. It would be in our interests and theirs to arm them more heavily in the future."
 pir_i6: "Why is the Rum Gone?"
 pir_i6_desc: "Privateers have plenty of techniques for running a blockade. We could use their expertise to enhance our own blockades, and prevent supplies and reinforcements from reaching the enemy."
 pir_i7: "Letters of Marque"
 pir_i7_desc: "Pirates tend to make the best privateers. By offering them official pardons in exchange for employment, we could greatly increase the effectiveness of our privateers."
 cul_i1: "Assimilation"
 cul_i1_desc: "Some may call it ethnic cleansing, some may call it an authoritarian strongarm of native peoples into accepting our language and customs. We prefer to see it as conquered populations appropriating our culture."
 cul_i2: "Public Relations Department"
 cul_i2_desc: "When the reputation of our state is smeared, we need diplomats to do damage control. In the past, this was a nebulous and disorganized endeavor - but today we may establish an official mouthpiece of the state, a voice with which to correct misconceptions about us."
 cul_i3: "National Pride"
 cul_i3_desc: "Parades, local customs to celebrate past victories, distinct cuisines and styles of clothing - we should distinguish ourselves from our neighbors by fostering a fierce national pride based on those idiosyncrasies which are distinctly ours."
 cul_i4: "Multiculturalism"
 cul_i4_desc: "It might seem contradictory to the notion of 'national pride' that we embrace multiculturalism, but we can maintain a culture of our own while still accepting the practices of others."
 cul_i5: "Export our Values"
 cul_i5_desc: "Tolerance of other cultures should be exported across Europe and the Maghreb! Developing our naval transportation methods and shipbuilding will allow us to ferry men around the world on a much larger scale, bringing the glory of the realm to those backwards enough not to have heard of it."
 cul_i6: "Heritage"
 cul_i6_desc: "The roots of the state are ancient. Some scholars claim our tongue was spoken in Eden itself, the first of all the languages in the world. Whether or not that's true, the government has a strong tradition reinforcing its legitimacy."
 cul_i7: "Eius Religio"
 cul_i7_desc: "'His Religion', yes, the religion of your neighbor - surely the same religion as yours! Poor is the land where the belief system of its population isn't tied to their cultural identity."
 log_i1: "Crusades"
 log_i1_desc: "What if church, state, and military can merge together at some common point? Take up arms, rich and poor, and defend the true faith from the unrelenting slings and arrows of heathenry."
 log_i2: "Echelons"
 log_i2_desc: "Outflanking the enemy can be essential to victory. More important however, is not getting outflanked ourselves. Splitting our cavalry units into smaller, more maneuverable divisions means we can more easily reinforce weak spots and react quicker to enemy attempts to flank."
 log_i3: "Positive Reinforcement"
 log_i3_desc: "'It's not about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.' - Rocco di Balboa"
 log_i4: "Motte"
 log_i4_desc: "Castles are essential to a well developed defense. Through reinforcing our most vulnerable lines of defense by smaller mottes, we can cut costs."
 log_i5: "Training Drills"
 log_i5_desc: "Regular training keeps the army fit and prepared for any eventuality."
 log_i6: "Navigation Tools"
 log_i6_desc: "Through the use of the astrolabe and the compass, our Captains have developed unparalleled navigation skills that ensure swift passage to any destination."
 log_i7: "Terrain Mastery"
 log_i7_desc: "Through extensive training and years of experience, our generals have learned how to use the terrain to their advantage. They are able to use their knowledge to move armies through unknown territory faster and attack into unfavorable positions without a disadvantage."
 man_i1: "Cooperative Fabrication"
 man_i1_desc: "If we can get the monasteries and other artisanal classes to work in tandem with the peasantry, we can cut much of the waste out of our production process."
 man_i2: "Build Windmills"
 man_i2_desc: "Ancient prototypes exist for a device which harnesses the power of winds to turn a grinding stone. New technological breakthroughs allow us to make this a reality, and greatly boost our production of foods and materials."
 man_i3: "The Art of Dodging"
 man_i3_desc: "Improving the processes of ore purification and then alloying will allow for us to supply better armor to the troops, and at lower costs. Why train for dodging when you can take a sword to the helm and survive?"
 man_i4: "Trade Infrastructure"
 man_i4_desc: "It would be beneficial to not only construct production facilities themselves, but buildings that can bolster our trade power - inns, customs houses, or banks, for example."
 man_i5: "Reinvestment"
 man_i5_desc: "All citizens know the taxes and tithes they pay eventually go back to their protection, benefit, and salvation. Of course, we could make the process more transparent by reinvesting our profit off individual cities directly back into them, rather than collecting the revenue in the state treasury for more general purposes."
 man_i6: "Trade Privileges"
 man_i6_desc: "By dictating special privileges to domestic traders and regulations for foreigners, we can get a stranglehold over all mercantile power in our lands. Exchange rates? Weak currencies inviting investments? We don't have to worry about that for centuries!"
 man_i7: "Standardized Blueprints"
 man_i7_desc: "Architecture on an ad-hoc basis is how we have operated since time immemorial, but now we should make an effort to use standardized plans for buildings and farms. It will be much less of a headache all around to construct fresh structures across the realm, allowing us to build at a fraction of the usual time."

 exploration_ideas_bonus: "Full Colonial Focus"
 LAU_diarchy_desc: "Once the Duchy of Saxony had been dissolved and our nation fully established, we spent an extensive few years under a diarchic government of Eric I and a few of his brothers. Dissolving this government and centralizing Lauenburg into a free duchy in its own right was a great challenge, but the political maneuverings taken by Eric I have made our dukes masters of statecraft and pleasing the court."
 LAU_church_of_hadeln_desc: "With the reformation burning its way through Europe, Lauenburg must decide whether it will remain loyal to the Vatican or branch out and form its own church based on the teachings of Luther. The People of Hadeln have already begun organizing an ecclesiastical order centered on the Reformation, and with our Duke's approval and embracement of Protestant teachings, the order could be officially recognized and form a vital part of our government."
 LAU_salty_salty_salty_desc: "The Old Salt Route is a trade route through Northern Germany, and Lauenburg is an important trade capital in this salty business. So profitable is this trade route that salt is often referred to as “white gold”, and although this “gold” can be easily acquired by boiling the briny waters of Lünburg, the profits it brings to Lauenburg through this lucrative trade speak for themselves."
 kammergericht_desc: "In order to regularize control of the Margraviate of Brandenburg the early rulers would replace local common law with Roman law. They would further regulate justice by moving the Supreme Court from the court of the Elector (who was prone to moving around) to fixed and central location. This simultaneously improved justice and curbed the power of local magnates."
 imperial_ambitions_desc: "The fall of the Carolingians led to chaos in the Empire and Salic administration has legalized anarchy by calling a constitution. However the Imperial title deserves to be held by our most noble house from its power base in Austria. We must achieve this title and then seek to reform the Empire to make it Holy, Roman, and an Empire once more."
 habsburg_dominance: "Diplomatic Dominance"
 thu_partition_of_leipizg: "Cavalry Heritage"
 thu_partition_of_leipizg_desc: "The first ever written accounts of the Thuringians come from Flavius Vegetius Renatus, a Roman military theorist, comparing the Thuringians to the Burgundians and the Huns. The later were feared cavalry man and so it is only plausible that the 'Toringi', our ancestors, were skilled cavalryman aswell."
 thu_saxon_duchies: "Legacy of Battlegrounds"
 thu_saxon_duchies_desc: "Our central position in the Holy Roman and Germany did not only make us a center of science and culture but has also painted our fields red. In almost every major war, battles took place on Thuringian soil. From the Thirty Years' War to the Schmalkaldic War and even the Twin Battles of Jena and Auerstadt, our country has watched the bloodshed. We sat and we learned."
 thu_weimar_clacissicism: "Beacon of Innovation"
 thu_weimar_clacissicism_desc: "For centuries, Thuringia has been the heartland of intellect and culture: From the Wartburg being a harbour of minstrelsy and birthplace of a unified German language to Weimar hosting the greatest minds of literature. And as Joseph Widmann once said: 'How likely is it that a small little country brought forth three different major intellectual genius?'"
 additional_colonists: "Claim Forgery"
 additional_colonists_desc: "The first step in fabricating claims is forging historical documents, ancient affidavits promising some land or other. By understanding philological disciplines, we can create more convincing frauds which even the most skeptical scholars will believe."
 quest_for_the_new_world_desc: "The new world is many things, most important of all, empty. Well no one important lives there at any rate. By letting people know of the boundless opportunities we have in the new world we will encourage more people to go forth and settle there."
 cat_fortifying_catalonia_desc: "Catalonia has many potential threats and enemies. The coasts have often come under attack by Barbary pirates and across the Pyrenees invasions have often been staged into the core of the Catalan region. We must do what we can to fortify our country to ensure the safety of our young state and to make the most of the local geography."
#Hashhashin
 hashshashin_ideas: "Hashashin Ideas"
 hashshashin_ideas_start: "Hashashin Traditions"

 hashshashins_creed: "Hashashin's Creed"

 avoid_bloodshed: "Avoid Bloodshed"
 avoid_bloodshed_desc: "The Hashashin preferred to achieve their goals without unnecessary bloodshed. If possible, they would avoid widespread killings by murdering key targets. This was known by the order's enemies and they were often persuaded to try the diplomatic route first."
 ismailis_dar_al_hijra: "The Ismailis Dar al-hijra"
 ismailis_dar_al_hijra_desc: "The fortresses became known as a refuge for men of their faith. Ismailis all over the region fled to the order for protection and safety."
 mountain_fortresses: "Mountain Fortresses"
 mountain_fortresses_desc: "The famous fortresses of the Hashashin were hidden in the mountains and very difficult to siege. Even if a foreign power conquered the province, the Hashashin still lingered in their fortresses and maintained control in the background."
 dagger_and_a_note: "A Dagger and a Note"
 dagger_and_a_note_desc: "A very common way for the order to perform diplomacy was to make the target know that they could get hurt if they did not choose wisely. A popular way was to scare enemy generals in the night by leaving a dagger and a note, then making sure the target woke up just before the assassin left. This let the general know that the order just as easily could have gotten rid of the troublemaker."
 murder_in_the_open: "Murder In the Open"
 murder_in_the_open_desc: "Fear was a very welcome tool to the Hashashin, using key targets as pawns in order to control the local populations of their enemies and making sure they would not dare oppose them. This was easiest accomplished by murdering in a public place like a market."
 revive_jihad_hassan: "Revive the Jihad of Hassan"
 revive_jihad_hassan_desc: "Hassan-i-Sabbah, the founder of the Hashashin, believed they were on a Jihad and defenders of their brethren. We should revive this thought and have young men flock to our armies in defense of Islam."

 letters_of_credit: "Letters of Credit"
 letters_of_credit_desc: "The journey of a Pilgrim is a very harsh one indeed, highwaymen and bandits looking for the valuables of defenseless Christians. The Order is tasked with defending the Pilgrims, one way we can do this is to store the pilgrim's valuables and giving them a letter of credit in return. This will make them much less likely to be targeted on the road." 
 assault_troops_of_the_crusades: "Assault Troops of the Crusades"
 assault_troops_of_the_crusades_desc: "The Knights of the order were always on the front lines of the Crusades and led the charge into the enemy. One legendary battle had 500 Templar knights break the lines of Saladin's 26 000 strong army."

 bank_of_europe_desc: "Our immense wealth has led us to be moneylenders to most of the royal houses of Europe. We are truly the bank of Europe!"
 the_templar_enterprise: "The Templar Enterprise"
 the_templar_enterprise_desc: "The order owns lands and estates in both Europe and the Middle East. We make wool, cloth, wine and food for the world to feast on. It has become quite hard to go anywhere without having to face something 'Made in Templar Land'. All kinds of jokes have started to appear of how we own the world and similar nonsense."
 the_supporting_infrastructure: "The Supporting Infrastructure"
 the_supporting_infrastructure_desc: "It may have started out as a military order, but the great amounts wealth gathered to support the military hierarchy has made us need a supporting infrastructure to manage our treasury."
 crusader_traditions: "Crusader Traditions"
 crusader_traditions_desc: "The order has a long tradition of participating in all the crusades; this has given us a great pool of veterans in the order who have seen the terrors of war. They are still willing to serve and thus we should put them to good use."

 TSS_idea_1: "Macedonia"
 TSS_idea_1_desc: "Thessaloniki takes its name from the sister of Alexander the Great, who in turn was named for the Macedonian victory over the Thessalians. Even in the early Middle Ages, coins and icons of Alexander were still venerated by the populace."
 TSS_idea_2: "Saint Paul"
 TSS_idea_2_desc: "Saint Paul, the greatest of Christ's followers, is remembered in the Biblical canon for his Letters to the Thessalonians. Paul stayed in the great Synagogue of Thessaloniki, a site now memorialized by the Blatades Monastery."

#Kališníci
 HGA_ideas: "Hussite Ideas"
 HGA_ideas_start: "Hussite Traditions"
 HGA_ideas_bonus: "Hussite Ambition"
 HGA_idea_1: "Remorseless Regicides"
 HGA_idea_1_desc: "Following the burning of Jan Hus, King Wenceslaus of Bohemia attempted to prevent the infuriated Hussite supporters from holding positions in Church and State. As a result, a rebellion ensued, culminating in the Defenestration of Prague, during which Hussites overtook the town hall and expelled several councilmen by throwing them out of a window. The King was so incensed and frightened by this incident that he passed away just two weeks later."
 HGA_idea_2: "Target of Multiple Crusades"
 HGA_idea_2_desc: "As a result of our heretical beliefs, the Catholic Pope initiated a total of five crusades against us, all of which we managed to repel successfully. This resulted in Bohemia becoming a constant battleground, causing immense suffering to the population. However, by reflecting on our past experiences, we can safeguard our subjects from the ravages of war in the future."
 HGA_idea_3: "Founders of Tábor"
 HGA_idea_3_desc: "In 1420, a group of radical Hussites founded the Bohemian town of Tábor, naming it after Mount Tabor in Galilee. The town boasted of a stringent equality policy, and its residents adhered to the principles of the early Christian model. It would be wise to dispatch additional believers to establish similar religious communities."
 HGA_idea_4: "Truth Prevails"
 HGA_idea_4_desc: "'Pravda vítezí' or 'Truth Prevails' is the revered motto of both our religion and state, symbolizing the triumph of truth above all else.

By embracing and embodying this theme, we can ensure the longevity and enduring legacy of our faith."
 HGA_idea_5: "The Four Articles of Prague"
 HGA_idea_5_desc: "The Four Articles of Prague embody the Hussite reform program, outlining four fundamental objectives aimed at renewal the Church. These goals include the freedom to preach the word of God, the right to celebrate communion under both kinds, a call for the clergy to embrace poverty and the expropriation of church property, and the establishment of a system for punishing mortal sins, regardless of an individual's social status. We hold these articles in high regard, as they encapsulate our unwavering commitment to religious reform."
 HGA_idea_6: "An Early Reformer"
 HGA_idea_6_desc: "Born in 1372, Jan Hus was the driving force behind the Hussite movement. His heretical sermons led to his excommunication, followed by his arrest and eventual execution in 1415. Despite his untimely demise, we continue to hold Jan Hus in high esteem as one of the earliest and most influential religious reformers."
 HGA_idea_7: "Democratic Character"
 HGA_idea_7_desc: "We refuse to yield to the despotic whims of a tyrannical monarch or the corrupt clergy. Our obligation is to resist any ruler who engages in the oppression of the people or infringes upon religious freedom.

 BZT_ideas_bonus: "Awrasian Ambition"
 BZT_idea_1: "Hannibal"

 BZT_idea_2: "Fort of Bizerte"
 BZT_idea_2_desc: "Bizerte traded hands several times after its Carthaginian origins, first coming to the Romans, then to the Vandals, and then to Byzantium before finally ending up under Islamic control. It was the Byzantines who built the fort of Bizerte to help protect their precarious possessions in North Africa."
 BZT_idea_3: "Tell Atlas"
 BZT_idea_3_desc: "The Tell Atlas is part of the larger Atlas mountain chain which straddles North Africa. A promontory of the range juts out into the Mediterranean, and it was in these coastal hills that the Awras tribes were nestled. This gives us powerful vantage points and protective benefits."
 BZT_idea_4: "Corsairs"
 BZT_idea_4_desc: "In its later history, Awras became a prominent haven for corsairs of the Mediterranean who wreaked havoc on Christian powers. Despite attempts from Venice to combat the piracy, it remained strong up until the French took control in 1881."
 BZT_idea_5: "Farming and Fishing"
 BZT_idea_5_desc: "The economy of the Awras coast is dynamic, and the populace is fed from both the rich oceans and the fertile hilly lands. Both cash crops and fruits and vegetables adorn the shorelines near the mountains and build up our economy."
 BZT_idea_6: "Hilalians"
 BZT_idea_6_desc: "As revenge for abandoning Shia Islam and declaring independence from the Fatimid Caliphate, the Caliphate sent several Arab tribes to invade and ruin Tunisia. These tribes included the Banu Hilal confederation, who were deeply involved in the process of Arabizing the local Berber tribes. In the modern era, the populace now consists of these integrated Arabs."
 BZT_idea_7: "Titular See"
 BZT_idea_7_desc: "Like many regions in Africa, Awras remained a titular see of the Catholic church for many centuries after it had fallen out of Christian hands and almost all Christians had left the area. We still have a presence in the minds of these infidels!"

 PNT_idea_1: "Count Eudon"
 PNT_idea_1_desc: "Eudon of Rennes was a Duke of Brittany and was compensated for his loss of the title with a strip of land covering the whole northern coast of Brittany. He engaged in open conflict with the new Breton Duke in an attempt to maintain his possession of the ancestral homeland of Rennes."
 PNT_idea_2: "Four Pays"
 PNT_idea_2_desc: "The original lands of the Viscounts of Pentevr spread across four different geographical regions, known as 'Pays' in French. These were Trégor, Saint-Brieuc, Saint-Malo, and Dol. This made our state the most powerful feudal vassal in all Brittany, and a rival to the Duke."
 PNT_idea_3: "Many Dynasties"
 PNT_idea_3_desc: "The title of Pentevr was frequently confiscated and regranted, and passed through the hands of many houses over the centuries. Families sourced from all over France have embellished our state with their fortunes and left indelible marks on the land."
 PNT_idea_4: "Heirs to Dumnonia"
 PNT_idea_4_desc: "The state of Pentevr closely matches the confines of the ancient Breton Kingdom of Dumnonia. We should emphasize a continuity between our legendary ancestors and our modern state."
 PNT_idea_5: "Jeanne la Boiteuse"
 PNT_idea_5_desc: "Joan the Lame, Countess of Pentevr, spurred the Breton Civil War along with her husband Charles against the house of Dreux. Though the claim was unsuccessful, we should never forget that the ducal title is rightfully ours!"
 PNT_idea_6: "Brioc"
 PNT_idea_6_desc: "Saint Brioc gives his name to the capital city of Pentevr, Saint-Brieuc. He was originally from Wales and was considered one of the seven foundational saints for Brittany."
 PNT_idea_7: "Bourbon-Penthièvre"
 PNT_idea_7_desc: "In the 1700s, an illegitimate branch of the house of Bourbon, itself descended from the Capetian Dynasty and ultimately the Frankish Robertians, took root in Pentevr. It is an honor to have this illustrious dynasty ruling in our homeland."
#Leoniz
 LNE_ideas: "Leonizian Ideas"
 LNE_ideas_start: "Leonizian Traditions"
 LNE_ideas_bonus: "Leonizian Ambition"
 LNE_idea_1: "The Other Leon"
 LNE_idea_1_desc: "Just as there is a Brest, Brittany and a Brest, Belarus, there is also a region of Leon in Brittany and one in Spain. The only thing to distinguish them are their accent marks, as the Breton one is spelled Léon and the Spanish one is spelled León. Ours, obviously, is the better one!"
 LNE_idea_2: "Independence"
 LNE_idea_2_desc: "Unlike the other feudal titles within Brittany, Leoniz was functionally independent and controlled its own destiny all the way up to the twelfth century when the English began to meddle in Breton affairs. We must preserve this distinction and never submit to external power."
 LNE_idea_3: "Communes Petitiones Britonum"
 LNE_idea_3_desc: "Along with the Viscounts of Pentevr, Leoniz drafted a series of complaints against the Breton Duke called the Communes Petitiones Britonum. This document confirmed Leoniz's 'Right of Wreck', the right to salvage shipwrecks, over a certain treacherous rock off the coast, which netted over 100,000 gold solidi per year."
 LNE_idea_4: "Armorican Peninsula"
 LNE_idea_4_desc: "Leoniz is at the farthest extreme of the Armorican Peninsula, jutting out into the Atlantic Ocean. This geographic position was part of the reason Leoniz was able to maintain its de-facto independence for such a long period of time."
 LNE_idea_5: "Kreisker Chapel"
 LNE_idea_5_desc: "Home to the tallest church tower in Brittany, the Chapel Itron-Varia ar C'hreiz-kêr dominates the ecclesiastical landscape of Leoniz. It became a recognizable monument for coastal navigation and Napoléon himself declared it must be spared from destruction. You can't spell Napoléon without Léon!"
 LNE_idea_6: "Artichokes"

 KNV_idea_2: "British Connections"
 KNV_idea_2_desc: "Just as Bretagne itself shares a name with the insular Bretagne across the channel, Cornouaille shares a name with another peninsula to its north. Known in English as Cornwall, this other region is also home to Brythonic peoples."
 KNV_idea_3: "Kern"
 KNV_idea_3_desc: "The flag of Kernev since 1426 is a white ram on a blue field. This animal was chosen because the name of the nation derives from 'kern', the Breton word for 'horn'. In ancient times, it was known as the 'land of the horned ones'."
 KNV_idea_4: "Abbey of Sainte-Croix"
 KNV_idea_4_desc: "Count Alain Canhiart, father to the first Breton Duke of the Kernev dynasty, founded the Abbey of Sainte-Croix in our capital Quimper. The Abbey boasts a spectacular Romanesque Basilica."

 NNT_idea_2_desc: "From 919 to 936, Nantes was occupied by the Viking leaders Rognvaldr and Incon who had come directly from Norway and received the city from the Frankish King Robert of Neustria. They have left an everlasting legacy on our people."
 NNT_idea_3: "Nantes Cathedral"
 NNT_idea_3_desc: "As the seat of a bishopric, Nantes is home to an imposing Cathedral. We should rebuild this Cathedral in the new Gothic style to increase the beauty of our city and signal our modern affiliations."
 NNT_idea_4: "Counts of Nantes"
 NNT_idea_4_desc: "Nantes as a separate title originated in the Frankish march defending against Breton armies. It later became an appanage title for members of the Breton ducal families, and even made its way into the hands of the Angevins eventually."
 NNT_idea_5: "Colonial Gateway"
 NNT_idea_5_desc: "As France set out to colonize the world, Nantes quickly became the largest port in the nation. Almost half of all slaves traded over the Atlantic Ocean went through Nantes."

 MIN_idea_4: "Curtail the Wichgraf"
 MIN_idea_4_desc: "The bishop had his rights towards the city residents exercised by the so-called 'Wichgraf', who acted as supreme administrative and judicial master. To the extent to which the citizens of Minden strengthened politically, they increasingly robbed the nobility of its tasks and importance. The same happened to the Wichgraf von Minden, who regularly clashed with the city council in the course of the 13th century. Around 1300, the council finally established a lower jurisdiction competing with the Wichgraf and six years later the bishop moved his residence out of the city. The office of the Wichgraf remained until the 18th century. However, he no longer had any influence on the administration of Minden."
 MIN_idea_5: "Hoffmannstropfen"
 MIN_idea_5_desc: "The Hoffmannstropfen was invented in the 17th century by Friedrich Hoffmann, a physician and garrison doctor who worked in Minden. This universal medicine can be used against weakness, fainting, cramps, vomiting and many other symptoms. Our troops will certainly last longer with these drops."
 MIN_idea_6: "HMS Minden"
 MIN_idea_6_desc: "The HMS Minden is a ship of the line of the Royal Navy, which was launched in 1810 in British Bombay, India. It is named after the Battle of Minden in 1759 during the Seven Years' War, in which British, Hanoverian and Prussian troops won a battle against the French."

 KZB_idea_1: "No Cats in Katzenelnbogen?"
 KZB_idea_1_desc: "The origin of the name 'Katzenelnbogen' has not been finally clarified. It could go back to the Latin name 'Cattimelibocus'. 'Catti' refers to the Germanic peoples of the Chatti, the modern Hessians, while 'Melibocus' means mountain or mountain range. No matter where our name comes from, it has nothing to do with cats."
 KZB_idea_2: "Adventurers and Crusaders"
 KZB_idea_2_desc: "A total of seven counts of Katzenelnbogen can be identified who made trips to the Orient or took part in crusades there. Count Berthold II of Katzenelnbogen was the informal leader of the German Crusader Army of the Fourth Crusade."
 KZB_idea_3: "Katzenelnbogener Rundbogenfries"

 KZB_idea_4: "Niedergrafschaft and Obergrafschaft"
 KZB_idea_4_desc: "The Katzenelnbogen territory was always divided into two main areas, the Niedergrafschaft around Katzenelnbogen and the castle of Rheinfels and the Obergrafschaft around Darmstadt. We should connect our domain with each other."

 KZB_idea_6: "Friend or Foe?"
 KZB_idea_6_desc: "Because of their wealth, the counts of Katzenelnbogen were always welcomed by emperors and kings. They often lent money to the emperor when he was short of money and could exert influence accordingly."
 KZB_idea_7: "St. Goarer Doppelzoll"
 KZB_idea_7_desc: "After the construction of Rheinfels Castle near St. Goar, the counts of Katzenelnbogen were able to collect customs duties from both the ships sailing up and down the Rhine, which helped the county to garner enormous wealth."

 WZL_idea_1_desc: "The final syllable of the city name -lar refers to a settlement of Celtic origin and is interpreted as a 'hurdle' or 'frame'. Presumably, this meant a fence-like fortification of a farm or village. Such cities have a distinctive location at river mouth angles and were probably built until the 3rd century."
 WZL_idea_2: "Early Iron Mining"
 WZL_idea_2_desc: "Iron has already been mined in and around Wetzlar in Celtic times. In the 13th century mining, metallurgy and the iron trade in Wetzlar were flourishing. Pig iron was traded as far as Frankfurt am Main. A statue of Saint Barbara adorns the fountain of the iron market."
 WZL_idea_3: "Numerous Orders of Knights"
 WZL_idea_3_desc: "From the 13th century onwards, several orders of knights settled in Wetzlar, including Franciscans, Dominicans, Carmelites, Cistercians, the Teutonic Knights and Premonstratensian Sisters."
 WZL_idea_4: "Feuds with Solms"
 WZL_idea_4_desc: "Decades of feuding with the Counts of Solms, who tried to make Wetzlar a Solmser city, threatened the vital trade routes. This is why Hermannstein Castle was built in the north of Wetzlar to further protect the town. The emperor also tried to protect the imperial city. Not until 1392 could peace be made with the Counts of Solms."
 WZL_idea_5: "Important Trade Routes"
 WZL_idea_5_desc: "The city was situated with fords through Lahn and Dill at the intersection of two trade routes. One of these was the historically important trade route Hohe Straße from Antwerp over Cologne and the imperial cities Wetzlar and Friedberg to Frankfurt am Main. The Weinstraße led from Mainz through Usingen and Wetzlar, past Marburg to the west, to Hildesheim and on to Bremen and Lübeck."
 WZL_idea_6: "Reformiertes Treppchen"
 WZL_idea_6_desc: "Since 1544 Wetzlar was one of the Protestant imperial estates. The Catholic Marienstift remained intact because it had been agreed to leave the choir room to the Catholic canons and the church nave to the Protestant-Lutheran congregation for church services. Calvinist religious refugees from Wallonia moved to Wetzlar in 1586. The former Franciscan church was assigned to them. The term 'Reformiertes Treppchen' for the lower part of the street called Jäcksburg still bears witness to the presence of the refugees."
 WZL_idea_7: "Hospital zum Heiligen Geist"

 SAS_idea_3: "Two Branches"
 SAS_idea_3_desc: "The Southern Ó Néills are divided into two main branches, descended respectively from two sons of Diarmait Mac Cerbaill, Colmán Már and Áed Sláine. These are the Clann Cholmáin, who rule Mhí proper, and us, the Síl nÁedo Sláine, who control Brega."

By 905, he was the de-facto ruler of Rome itself, having faithfully served as Palatinus Iudex to Emperor Louis III. He and his wife Theodora nominated Popes and spread their influence throughout Latium."
 LZO_idea_2: "Saeculum Obscurum"
 LZO_idea_2_desc: "The papal 'Dark Age', also known as the Pornocracy (rule of prostitutes) or Hetaerocracy (rule of mistresses), occurred in the tenth century when Count Theophylactus of Tusculum and his descendants controlled the Papacy. The first period lasted 905-964, and in the following century they achieved Papal power again from 1012-1048. The final Tusculan Pope, Benedict IX, was the only man to serve more than one term as Pope and the only man to have literally sold the Papacy."
 LZO_idea_3: "Roman Commune"
 LZO_idea_3_desc: "In late 1143 a popular agitator named Giordano Pierleoni encouraged the people of Rome to overthrow Papal sovereignty and re-establish the ancient Roman Republic ruled by a senate. This incredible Republican innovation lives on in the hearts and minds of Latians."
 LZO_idea_4: "Restore Tusculum"
 LZO_idea_4_desc: "Tusculum was the site of many struggles and battles as the Popes fought the power of the Counts and then the various noble families of Rome fought each other. Over time it was reduced to a ruin. We must invest in the restoration of this glorious Roman suburb."
 LZO_idea_5: "Liberalism"
 LZO_idea_5_desc: "Rome was established as a Republic very briefly under Napoléon, but under its own auspices later on in 1849. This second modern Roman Republic was ruled by a Triumvirate including the Italian unification hero Giuseppe Mazzini. This republic was a triumph of constitutional liberalism and though it only stood for a month, its people later escaped Papal domination once and for all a few decades later."
 LZO_idea_6: "Vino Lazio"

 LZO_idea_7: "The Black Nobility"
 LZO_idea_7_desc: "When the forces of Giuseppe Garibaldi rolled into Latium to annex the Papacy definitively to the new Italian state, a handful of the ancient noble families of Rome sided with the Papacy. These were later called the 'black nobility', and included such kin groups as the Orsini, Colonna, and Aldobrandini. They earned the name because they kept their doors closed in a sign of mourning, but some theorize they are secretly a World Government with their own 'black pope', descending from the Ptolemaic Dynasty and thirteen occult Zoroastrian Bloodlines."

 DLN_idea_5_desc: "Our fiercest rivals are the Dál Fiatach, who rule Ulster proper. They claim descent from the Érainn tribe, known to Greco-Romans as Inverni, rather than the Priteni. Regardless of their origins, we must push them further into their hinterlands and ensure they cannot establish full power over Ulaidh again."
 DLN_idea_6: "Entryism"
 DLN_idea_6_desc: "Within the Ó Tuirtri clan was a cadet branch, the Ó Fhloinn, who moved into our lands under pressure from other groups.

 SUI_idea_3_desc: "The Southern Ó Néills are divided into two main branches, descended respectively from two sons of Diarmait Mac Cerbaill, Áed Sláine and Colmán Már. These are the Síl nÁedo Sláine, who rule Brega, and us, the Clann Cholmáin, who control Mhí proper." 
 SUI_idea_4: "Magh Breagh"
 SUI_idea_4_desc: "Brega is one of the main Kingdoms of the Mhí region, and takes its name from the phrase 'Magh Breagh', meaning 'fine plain'. The surrounding countryside is indeed suitable for plantation and farming, keeping our Clann Cholmáin people well-fed."
 SUI_idea_5: "Cnoc na Teamhrach"
 SUI_idea_5_desc: "The Hill of Tara is perhaps the most important royal site in Ireland. Atop it stands the Lia Fáil - the Stone of Destiny - one of the Four Treasures of the Tuatha Dé Danann. These treasures were brought to Ireland from mysterious cities across the sea in ancient times, and the Stone will cry out when the rightful King stood on it."
 SUI_idea_6: "Remember Máel Sechnaill"
 SUI_idea_6_desc: "Máel Sechnaill Mac Domnaill, founder of the Ó Máel Sechnaill branch of Clann Cholmáin, was the last truly undisputed High King of Ireland. Over thirty years prior to Brian Boru's crushing victory over the Viking Scourge at Clontarf, Máel Sechnaill beat the Dublin vikings at the Battle of Tara and took over this legendary city. When treacherous Boru overthrew him, the alternating High King system was ruined. We must honor the legacy of our last hero!"
 SUI_idea_7: "An Pháil"
 SUI_idea_7_desc: "It is well known that the regions around Dublin were the core of English power in Ireland, even centuries before the Tudor conquest. This area, which we now occupy, was cordoned off with stakes called 'pales', and beyond it lay the wild untamed tribes of Ireland."

 TTC_idea_1_desc: "Our tribe takes its name from the three grandsons of the third-century High King Cairbre Lifechair, all of whom were named Colla. Cairell Colla Uais ruled as High King after killing his uncle, and was brother to Muiredach Colla Fo Chrí and Áed Colla Menn. All three were eventually exiled to Scotland."
 TTC_idea_2: "The Prophecy of the Collas"
 TTC_idea_2_desc: "It was said that whoever killed one of the three Collas would have his descendants cursed never to rule Ireland. It was for this reason that they were exiled rather than killed when they fell from power."
 TTC_idea_3: "Musical Thrones"
 TTC_idea_3_desc: "Unlike most Irish Kingdoms, the Trí Colla Septs within Airgialla frequently went in and out of power. The Ó Laidhgnén, Ó Baoighealláin, Ó Cearbhaill, Ó hEignigh, Ó hAnluain, and Mac Mathghamha all ruled it within the space of two centuries."
 TTC_idea_4: "Kings of Airgialla"
 TTC_idea_4_desc: "When the Collas returned from their exile in Scotland, they managed to crush the power of the Kings of Ulaidh, and from this conquest was born the Kingdom of Airgialla, ruled by their descendants."
 TTC_idea_5: "Centurions"
 TTC_idea_5_desc: "Some theorize that during their time in Scotland, then ruled by the Roman Empire, the Collas enlisted in the Roman Army and became centurions. This might have been why they all had the same cognomen and why each led 100 soldiers."
 TTC_idea_6: "Loch nEathach"
 TTC_idea_6_desc: "Lough Neagh dominates the northern borders of the lands of the Trí Colla. It was around the shores of this lake that the Ó hAnluians centered their small Kingdom, the Kingdom of Airthir. Fishing this lake has been an economic staple for centuries."
 TTC_idea_7: "Réamonn Ó hAnluain"
 TTC_idea_7_desc: "Long after the Irish lords of Ireland had fallen from power, Septs of the Trí Colla remained significant in the north. One of the more notable members of the O'Hanlon clan was Redmond, a wandering rogue and 'tóraidhe' who acted like a Robin Hood for the Irish people."

 GLN_idea_2: "Mora, Brega, and Connacht"
 GLN_idea_2_desc: "The Gailenga people, those toponymically associated with Connacht, actually founded three kingdoms across Ireland. Aside from the most famous Connacht branch, there were also kings in Meath who ruled the localities of Brega and Mora."
 GLN_idea_3: "Three Gailenga"
 GLN_idea_3_desc: "The Gailenga tribe was divided into threes twice over. The Gailengas outside of Connach split into many septs, but the most prestigious were the Ó Lóthcháin, Ó hAonghusa, and Mac Maoláin."
 GLN_idea_4: "Vassal Tribe"
 GLN_idea_4_desc: "Historians believe the Gailenga first served as a vassal tribe under the warrior classes of the Connachta. When the Connachta would conquer a new territory, they would settle their warriors there and thus the Gailenga with them. We must remember what it was like to be a subject."
 GLN_idea_5: "Deoise Achadh Conaire"
 GLN_idea_5_desc: "In the twelfth century, the lands of the Gailenga in Connacht were absorbed into the Diocese of Achonry. The treaty, uniting us under that most pious of bishoprics, recognized the Gailenga as the overkings of northern Connacht."
 GLN_idea_6: "Sliabh Gamh"
 GLN_idea_6_desc: "The Sliabh Gamh, or 'Ox Mountains', are a natural barrier that has assisted the Gailenga in their hold over Connacht. In addition to the Corrshliabh mountains, we are practically impervious to invasion from the north or south!"
 GLN_idea_7: "Bishops of Down"
 GLN_idea_7_desc: "Ulster may seem the last place one would expect to find Gailenga in power, but nevertheless we have spread even there. Members of the Mac Maoláin Sept were recorded as bishops in the local diocese of Connor and Down."

Ivar was a son of the legendary Viking hero Ragnar Lothbrok and one of the leaders of the Great Heathen Army that terrorized Anglo-Saxon England in the ninth century. He was known as one of the main founders of Norse power in the Kingdom of the Isles, previously Gaelic Dál Riata."
 NSG_idea_2: "Kings of Dyflin"
 NSG_idea_2_desc: "Dublin, the principal city of all Ireland, rose to prominence as a Viking settlement. For generations, Viking power in Ireland was projected from Dublin where a series of Gall-Goídil ruled as Kings. Even after the Vikings were subjugated at the Battle of Clontarf, the area still maintained heavy Norse influence."
 NSG_idea_3: "Seven Septs"

 NSG_idea_4: "Gallowglasses"
 NSG_idea_4_desc: "The gall óglaigh - 'foreign warriors' - were an elite mercenary class in medieval Ireland. Many clans like the Mac Suibhnes descended from these warriors, and native clan leaders would choose a company of Gallowglasses as their personal bodyguards since they were thought detached from local politics, like the Varangians of Byzantium."
 NSG_idea_5: "Restore Caill Tomair"
 NSG_idea_5_desc: "The Grove of Thor outside of Dublin, Caill Tomair, was vandalized by the troops of Brian Boru around the turn of the millennium. We must restore this artifact of our ancient Norse religious heritage!"
 NSG_idea_6: "Ostmen Rights"
 NSG_idea_6_desc: "When the English and Normans occupied Ireland starting in 1172, they saw the Gall-Goídil as a special class separate from the native Irish. For this reason, they granted us special rights and privileges which the native Irishmen were deprived, and referred to us as Ostmen."
 NSG_idea_7: "Merchant Class"
 NSG_idea_7_desc: "As the English occupation continued, the Gall-Goídil abandoned their warlike ways and took on a variety of new roles that made them important in the Irish economy. Some became merchants, some craftsmen and farmers. Their importance caused the English crown to grant them even more rights and protections on top of their previous ones."

 CNT_idea_4: "Kings of Cruachan"
 CNT_idea_4_desc: "One of the earliest titles of the Connachta was 'King of Cruachan', at modern Rathcroghan. This sprawling archaeological site consists of an iron age mound with many ruins around it, and is said to contain Ireland's gate to hell. In pagan times, this passage to the Otherworld in Oweynagat Cave was used for rituals like the Samhain harvest festival."
 CNT_idea_5: "Queen Medb"

While we were fighting with our stronger foes, our people helped us and never questioned our reign during this time. This helped us to keep stability in the nation."
 SPT_idea_6: "Relations With the Pope"
 SPT_idea_6_desc: "The Pope has interests on our lands and they will try to invade us or make us their puppet when the time will come. Sadly, the Emperor is supporting them against us but as a Catholic nation arguing with the Pope would be suicide. Maybe we can try to understand one of the heretic belief systems and convert from Catholicism because we are seeing that the Pope cares more for his own interests than for God and His holy mission."

 LDI_idea_1_desc: "Even if we have similar cultural ties, our people are not enthusiastic about being slaves to Milan. Though we are a small commune, we are ready to give up on everything to not lose our freedom. That's why, in a war that threatens our freedom, everyone will want to join the army to save their country."
 LDI_idea_2: "Cathedral of Lodi"
 LDI_idea_2_desc: "Founded on the 3rd of August 1158, the Cathedral of Lodi is one of the most important and biggest cathedrals in Northern Italy. The beauty of the cathedral will help us to show our people how much we care about Christianity."
 LDI_idea_3: "Treaty of Lodi"
 LDI_idea_3_desc: "To end their hostilities, several major Italian powers decided to sign a treaty. This treaty was signed in Lodi, and it has surely turned Lodi into a center of peace and made it more important than ever."
 LDI_idea_4: "Effects of the Renaissance"
 LDI_idea_4_desc: "The Renaissance is one of the most important events in history and the starting region of the Renaissance is Italy. We are one of the most important Renaissance cities within Italy and some important representatives of the Renaissance lived in Lodi. These artists will affect our people greatly and make them open for reforms."
 LDI_idea_5: "Legacy of St. Bassianus"
 LDI_idea_5_desc: "St. Bassianus is the first and patron Bishop of Lodi. He was a precious saint who fled from his father to avoid returning to Syracuse's faith. When he became the Bishop of Lodi, he did so many important things for Lodi and Christianity. Now we have his legacy and this can give us some influence over the Papacy."
 LDI_idea_6: "Farming Traditions"
 LDI_idea_6_desc: "Lodi is a brilliant place for farming. It has a river to irrigate crops, the weather is decent, and the terrain is suitable. A farmer can produce so many things in Lodi like rice and wheat. Producing goods is also important for trade. Thus in Lodi there have been centuries of farming and this farming tradition over generations of people gives us many supplies."
 LDI_idea_7: "Banco Popolare di Lodi"

 SDZ_idea_1: "Testament of Boleslaw Wrymouth"
 SDZ_idea_1_desc: "In 1138 the great Polish King Boleslaw died and, according to his will, the nation was divided between his many sons. Thus the Duchy of Sandomierz, covering much of Lesser Poland, was first created. The first duke, Henry, took part in the crusades and found fortune in the Holy Land."
 SDZ_idea_2: "Seniorate Connections"
 SDZ_idea_2_desc: "The most curious aspect of Boleslaw Wrymouth's will was his establishment of the so-called 'seniorate province' with its capital at Kraków. Rather than having a hereditary ruler, the province would be passed between the other dukes as a symbol of supremacy. Since Sandomierz was closest to Kraków, our dukes were often rulers of the seniorate and had an easy time controlling it."
 SDZ_idea_3: "Battle of Zawichost"
 SDZ_idea_3_desc: "The ambitious Russian prince Roman the Great invaded Lesser Poland in 1205 to annex it for himself, but the local ruler Leszek the White and his brother Konrad joined forces to ambush the would-be conqueror. A battle was fought by the Vistula river at Zawichost in which the enemy were so utterly routed that Roman the Great was killed and Poland would gain the upper hand against the Rus for centuries to come."
 SDZ_idea_4: "Lublin"
 SDZ_idea_4_desc: "The impressive city of Lublin is a regional capital within Lesser Poland, and is home to the Old Town historical district. The 1578 Crown Tribunal (Trybunal Koronny) building, created to check the power of the Sejm, dominates the complex."
 SDZ_idea_5: "Recover from the Mongols"
 SDZ_idea_5_desc: "In the thirteen century the Mongol hordes raided Lesser Poland extensively, sacking Sandomierz twice in 1241 and 1260. It is high time we invested in the restoration of damaged cities and bring the region back to prosperity."
 SDZ_idea_6: "Establish Castellanies"
 SDZ_idea_6_desc: "To exert influence over local municipalities, the dukes of Sandomierz divided it into twelve castellanies, each ruled by appointed castellans. These were Luków, Lublin, Sieciechów, Radom, Skrzynno, Zarnów, Malogoszcz, Czchów, Wislica, Polaniec, Zawichost, and Sandomierz."
 SDZ_idea_7: "Polish Renaissance"
 SDZ_idea_7_desc: "In the period after Poland's feudal fragmentation, Lesser Poland became relatively peaceful and thus a ripe location for Renaissance thought. Many great scholars and diplomats came out of Lesser Poland, and the act which created the Commonwealth was signed within it."

We declared our independence from them in 1045 after decades of governance and now have the prestige of having overthrown this hated dynasty."
 IFQ_idea_2: "Dynastic Connections"
 IFQ_idea_2_desc: "Though dynastic ties didn't mean as much (with regards to feudal titles) in the Islamic World as in the Christian West, the Zirids nevertheless spread their scions to both Andalucian taifas and Sicilian qâdîts."
 IFQ_idea_3: "Ifriqiya"
 IFQ_idea_3_desc: "The ancient Roman province of Africa stretched from Cyrenaica to Bejaia, and gives its name to our nation. It was one of the most economically productive provinces of the Empire and taking it for the Dar al-Islam was a glorious success by the will of Allâh."
 IFQ_idea_4: "Sanhaja Berbers"
 IFQ_idea_4_desc: "Unlike many dynasties of Africa, which were established by Berberized Arab foreigners, the Zirids were a true native Berber dynasty of the Sanhaja tribe. This will benefit our hold over the disparate Berber ethnicities that make up the Maghreb."
 IFQ_idea_5: "Kairouan"
 IFQ_idea_5_desc: "Kairouan is the jewel of Ifriqiya, the center of its cultural and economic life. Many scholars flocked to the city to take part in its rich secular-intellectual and religious communities."
 IFQ_idea_6: "Import Timber"
 IFQ_idea_6_desc: "Under the Zirids, trade in the Maghreb reached a high point. Ibn Khaldun called the empire under al-Mu‘izz the most flourishing of all Berber states through history. Close ties were established with the rulers of Islamic Sicily to ensure timber would make its way to Ifriqiya for the construction of fleets."
 IFQ_idea_7: "Fifty First Dates"
 IFQ_idea_7_desc: "Dates, the fruit of the Date Palm, are a staple of the Maghrebi economy. The historian Ibn Khaldun, in his travels across the many cities of Africa, would try new date strains in each city and record his thoughts on them."

Temples to Apollo, Athena, and Hera dotted the mountains of Mani all the way up to the twelfth century. The project was started by the well-known Byzantine missionary Saint Nikon the Metanoeite."
 MNI_idea_2: "Unconquerable"
 MNI_idea_2_desc: "In its entire post-antique history, Mani was never involuntarily annexed to any state. Even the mighty Ottoman Empire was unable to establish definitive control over the peninsula, and Mani remained a center of constant rebellions against Turkish rule."
 MNI_idea_3: "Menegoi and Ezeritai"
 MNI_idea_3_desc: "The Maniots aren't the only eccentric group occupying the southern Peloponnese. There are also the settled Slavic tribes called Melingoi and Ezeritai occupying the Taygetos Mountains and the Taskonites occupying the Parnon mountains. Together these ethnic blocs can field a formidable army."
 MNI_idea_4: "Establish Castles"
 MNI_idea_4_desc: "The Princes of Achaea tried to bring order to the Maniots by constructing fortresses that commanded the land passes and the sea around them. Passavas and Magne Maina were constructed by Guillaume II de Villehardouin in the 1250s - we can use them to our advantage."
 MNI_idea_5: "Venetian Ties"
 MNI_idea_5_desc: "Frequently the Maniots would turn to Venice for assistance, entering into mutually beneficial pacts where Venice would receive trading and mooring rights while Mani would be supplied troops and arms."
 MNI_idea_6: "Klephts"
 MNI_idea_6_desc: "Starting with Limberakis Gerakaris in the 1660s, Mani was the base of operations for numerous 'klephts' - bandits and pirates. Some of the notable klephts who raided Ottoman supply lines were Lambros Katsonis, Andreas Androutsos, and Zacharias Barbitsiotis."
 MNI_idea_7: "Beys of Mani"
 MNI_idea_7_desc: "The Ottomans, frustrated at the impossibility of subjugating Mani, decided to formalize its autonomy by recognizing the local chieftains as Beys on behalf of the empire. The last leader, Petrobey (Petros Mavromichalis), was a father of the Greek War of Independence."

 SRU_idea_5_desc: "In 1374, the ruler of Saruhan had the Great Mosque (Ulu Camii) of Manisa built, whose prayer hall is crowned by a 14-meter wide dome. The building served as a model for the Üç-Serefeli mosque, which was built 60 years later by the Ottoman Sultan Murad II. In the future it will be easier for our master builders and architects to design and build such impressive buildings."
 SRU_idea_6: "Reconstruction of Byzantine Defences"
 SRU_idea_6_desc: "The region around Manisa was badly affected by repeated looting by the Turks in the 13th century. The city walls and citadels built by the Byzantines were destroyed. By rebuilding any unusable defenses in the country, we can improve the defenses in the country relatively cheaply."
 SRU_idea_7: "Threatened by the Ottomans"

 AYD_idea_2: "Thriving Piracy"
 AYD_idea_2_desc: "In 1317, Smyrna was attacked by Aydin and the castle hill inland was captured. However, the lower town with the harbour and the new fortress there remained initially in Genoese hands. After the port was also conquered in 1329, the piracy of Aydin began to flourish. The pirate ships reach the Venetian island of Negroponte and also appear near the Greek mainland."
 AYD_idea_3: "Cooperation with Byzantium"
 AYD_idea_3_desc: "In 1335, Aydin formed an alliance with the Byzantines against Venice, Genoa and the Knights of St John, which guaranteed peace in the region for several years. Aydin lent soldiers and ships to the Byzantine emperor, who wanted to recapture Lesbos from Genoa."
 AYD_idea_4: "Important Naval Power"

 AYD_idea_6: "Major Grain Supplier"
 AYD_idea_6_desc: "The area of Aydin is of great importance as a grain supplier, for example to Rhodes. In 1379, Pope Clement VII had to allow the knights there to buy grain from us, because hunger forced them to do so."

 MEN_idea_2: "Hinterland of Caria"
 MEN_idea_2_desc: "Mentese is located in the hinterland of Caria, which is mostly mountainous and hilly, crossed by smaller rivers. Agriculture is not possible in the mountains, which is why it is limited to a few plains and estuaries. However, the coast of Caria is of great importance for trade, as several inland roads converge here."
 MEN_idea_3: "Rule over Rhodes"
 MEN_idea_3_desc: "At the beginning of the 14th century, the island of Rhodes was under the rule of Mentese. Around 1310, it was conquered by the Knights of St. John with the help of the French king. An attempt to reconquer by the Turks was unsuccessful. With a larger transport fleet we can try to conquer other Greek islands."
 MEN_idea_4: "Wealthy Trading State"
 MEN_idea_4_desc: "Mentese is a prosperous state due to its flourishing trade, which attracts many merchants from foreign countries. Grain is the main export commodity of Mentese, but slaves, alum, horses and other animals are also exported."

 GMU_idea_2_desc: "In a document by Frederick Barbarossa Gmünd is mentioned as 'burgum Gemunde'. The term 'burgum' was used in the High Middle Ages for castles and fortified towns. Gmünd has therefore been a city with walls and towers since the 12th century."

Dresden Stollen (or Striezel) is a particularly rich butter-raisin stollen; the use of butter is said to date back to the 'Dresden Butter Letter' issued by Pope Innocent VIII in 1491, which abolished the necessary renunciation of butter during Lent.

Villehardouin wrote the definitive Latin account of the Fourth Crusade and was closely involved in the taking of Constantinople."
 ACH_idea_2: "Parliaments of Ravennika"
 ACH_idea_2_desc: "Twice the Crusader nobility of the Aegean convened at Ravennika in a so-called 'parliament' to lay down rules and resolve violent conflicts. These meetings were like self-appointed Ecumenical Councils and marked the dominance of the secular aristocracy over the Catholic Church's clerics. This state of affairs continually angered the Popes who believed the Crusader lords had too much freedom."

 ACH_idea_5: "Mountainous"
 ACH_idea_5_desc: "Achaea is known for its mountains, like the great Mount Kyllini which was thought to be the birthplace of Hermes in Greek mythology. More practically, these mountains allow small castles to control great stretches of land and for villages to be built hidden from the view of potential prowling ships in the surrounding oceans."

The county of Bitsch-Zweibrücken had two counts, one for Bitsch and one for Zweibrücken, and only a small part of the county was mutually ruled. The counts did not have a solid rule and authority: sometimes they recognized the count of Lorraine as their superior authority, sometimes they applied the Imperial Immediacy. Overall Bitsch remained very loyal and independent from Lorraine."
 ZBB_idea_2: "Geographically Isolated"
 ZBB_idea_2_desc: "Already from the 13th century, Bitsch was the only place in the Lorrainian region that was German-speaking. The county of Zweibrücken was too fractured to be considered German- or French-speaking. Because of this situation, the County was a bit isolated."
 ZBB_idea_3: "Please Accept Achen as Gift"
 ZBB_idea_3_desc: "Achen is a small village that started as part of the lordship of Lützelstein, but was gifted away in the 12th century to the new count of Bitsch. In the 13th century, the town was returned back to the lords of Lützelstein. The village then was gifted to the Abbey of Sturzelbronn, who later traded the village for salt with the count of Lorraine, reuniting the village with Bitsch."
 ZBB_idea_4: "Kaltenhausen"
 ZBB_idea_4_desc: "Kaltenhausen was a settlement close to the original castle of Bitsch, and near the Horn river and an important lake. The settlement attracted many merchants and artisans who felt themselves safe inside the city walls (that were laid very early) with two town gates. Unfortunately, these walls had a big impact on the space available, and while measures like making very narrow streets helped, they could not prevent the place from hitting its maximum capacity and thus stopping most of its economic growth. The settlement was razed to the ground by the Swedes."
 ZBB_idea_5: "Succession War for the County"
 ZBB_idea_5_desc: "A succession war raged between the Protestant count of Hanau-Lichtenberg and the Catholic count of Lorraine. It started with the death of the count of Bitsch. Two other counts had the possibility to inherit the county, but the much stronger count of Hanau-Lichtenberg absolutely wanted to impose the Protestant faith, which led to problems with a nearby abbey and Lorraine. The other count, knowing he wouldn't get the inheritance, sold it instead to Lorraine. Lorraine quickly declared war on Hanau, who now was the weakling of the two possible inheritors. Instead of just giving up, he took juridical measures. Eventually, after almost 35 years, the county was split in favor of Lorraine without many shots having been fired."
 ZBB_idea_6: "Bitscherland Destroyed"
 ZBB_idea_6_desc: "Like many other counties of the region, Bitsch suffered a lot from the Peasants' War. Several castles went up in flames but the peasants failed to achieve their demands and were massacred by the Count. When Bitsch got incorporated into Lorraine, the administration was modernized and the jurisdiction reorganized, which initially produced an economic boom, but already in the mid-1600s turned into a prolonged recession. As a result of the Thirty Years' War, the people had to deal with marauding troops and rampant epidemics. After all that, the land was devastated and depopulated. Some villages and numerous castles were completely gone."
 ZBB_idea_7: "L'Éclatement du District de Bitsch"
 ZBB_idea_7_desc: "Much of the territory of Bitsch had long been held and influenced by the Clergy. But when the very anti-clerical French State acquired the lands, things went wrong. The new district of Bitsch terrorized the clergy and the people. On top of that, the very high taxes made life unbearable, and after only a few years the whole district burst and had to be redivided. But it didn't stop the almost nine centuries of ecclesiastical influence to be destroyed and replaced by local elites."

Let us continue to bear the torch of the Bulgarian state and someday pass our freedom to our brethren."
 LVC_idea_4: "Militant Diplomacy"

 MOE_idea_1: "This is Sparta"
 MOE_idea_1_desc: "The core of the Despotate of Morea in its original 1349 foundation was around the southern Peloponnese, where the ruins of ancient Sparta lay. Sparta has been famed throughout the West in all ages for its unparalleled warrior-cult society and its steadfastness in the wars with Achaemenid Persia."
 MOE_idea_2: "Kantakouzenoi"
 MOE_idea_2_desc: "Morea was created as an appanage for the sons of successive Byzantine emperors, and as such it was first granted to Manuel Kantakouzenos, scion of then-ruler John VI. The Kantakouzenoi were one of the most wealthy and powerful families among all the Greek peoples since the times of the Komnenoi and many later families of Eastern Europe trace their lineage to them."
 MOE_idea_3: "Invite Albanian Settlers"
 MOE_idea_3_desc: "One of the innovations of Theodoros Palaiologos was to invite Albanians to settle the Peloponnese in an attempt to mitigate its population and manpower decline. These Greco-Albanians were part of the larger ethnic group known as Arvanites or Arbanites."
 MOE_idea_4: "Isthmus of Corinth"
 MOE_idea_4_desc: "This tiny natural land bridge is all that links the Peloponnesian peninsula to mainland Greece and Europe. It is an incredible defensive advantage that allows our state to be virtually immune to land invasion."
 MOE_idea_5: "Feudal Divisions"
 MOE_idea_5_desc: "In the late Palaiologan era, Morea became divided between co-ruling sons, such as Demetrios and Thomas Palaiologos. Though the pair were unpopular and suffered a major peasant revolt, the idea of turning Morea into Theme-like locally-ruled titles is not a bad one."
 MOE_idea_6: "Restore the Haxamilion"
 MOE_idea_6_desc: "In 1446 Murad II, Sultan of the Ottoman Turks, dismantled the realm's most important defensive bulwark, the Hexamilion Wall, which straddled the Isthmus of Corinth and ensured that no hostile armies would pass through it. We should gather together all the stone and masons we can to restore this great wall of the Morea!"
 MOE_idea_7: "Monemvasia"
 MOE_idea_7_desc: "The Morea's greatest advantages are all in its natural geography, and Monemvasia is no different. At the tip of a sharp peninsula on the larger Peloponnese, Monemvasia can be used as an easily-defensible port and was indeed the only part of the whole region held onto by the Byzantines after the Fourth Crusade in 1204."

 PAR_idea_2: "Orlando 'del Rosso'"
 PAR_idea_2_desc: "For over two hundred years, Parma was under the thumb of the de' Rossi family. These benevolent signori originated in the figure of Orlando, nicknamed 'del Rosso', who was a skilled condottieri in the service of the Holy Roman Emperor and was even named Imperial Vicar of Italy in 1162."

 PAR_idea_5: "Pope Paul III"
 PAR_idea_5_desc: "The Farnese family of Parma, a powerful force in Renaissance Italy, had inroads into Latium that paid off during the counter-reformation when Alessandro Farnese ascended to the Papacy as Paul III. His pontificate was colored by rich artistic patronage, the popularization of Roman Catholic religious orders such as the Jesuits, and the convention of the famous Council of Trent."
 PAR_idea_6: "Guillaume du Tillot"
 PAR_idea_6_desc: "It seems unusual for a Frenchman to be tied to the fortune of an Italian city, but Parma flourished under the administration of the French politician Léon Guillaume du Tillot. His enlightenment ideals curbed ancient church privileges, reinvigorated the city's industry, and founded great institutions such as the Biblioteca Palatina and Botanical Garden."

 MOD_idea_2: "Canto delle Scolte Modenesi"
 MOD_idea_2_desc: "In the ninth century, a nameless poet wrote a haunting lyric poem about the guards of Modena's city walls. These guardsmen were facing brutal attacks from the Magyar raiders and the poem's encouragement was a welcome gesture."
 MOD_idea_3: "University of Modena"
 MOD_idea_3_desc: "It is often claimed that the University of Bologna is the oldest in Europe, but of course everyone knows that the University of Modena was founded several decades earlier in 1175! We cannot let this plainly obvious mistake go uncorrected!"
 MOD_idea_4: "House of Este"
 MOD_idea_4_desc: "The margraves of Este north of nearby Ferrara took power in Modena starting in 1288, and after some interludes of revolution maintained power for centuries afterward. This illustrious dynasty was descended from the Obertenghi, the supreme power of northwest Italy in the Middle Ages."
 MOD_idea_5: "Build the Ducal Palace"
 MOD_idea_5_desc: "Duke Francesco I started construction of the ducal palace of Modena in the mid 1600s after the family's original seat, Ferrara, was lost to the Papacy. The imposing baroque structure commands the city at the site of an ancient castle."
 MOD_idea_6: "Mary of Modena"
 MOD_idea_6_desc: "A scion of house Este, Mary became queen consort of England and Scotland when she married James II Stuart. When the family was deposed by the Glorious Revolution in 1688, she became a 'queen in exile' in France. Despite this sad turn of events, Modena clearly has rich diplomatic connections."
 MOD_idea_7: "Integrate the Jews"
 MOD_idea_7_desc: "Since the 1300s Jewish communities have populated Modena, though often living in poverty within their ghetto.

Even though we were the first of these nations to be surpassed and perished, we can use our potential and expand our influence in the Mediterranean."
 AML_idea_2: "Founded by Heracles"
 AML_idea_2_desc: "A legend tells that the name of the city comes from Amalfi, a nymph who was in love with Heracles and whose name was Amalfi. She died very young and Heracles buried her here, in the most beautiful place for him, and founded a town with her name."
 AML_idea_3: "Richest City in Lombardy"
 AML_idea_3_desc: "During its heyday in the 10th century, Amalfi was praised by Arab travellers as the 'richest and most glamorous city' in the Lombard Kingdom. Our republic, which also included neighboring towns, had more than 50,000 inhabitants at that time."
 AML_idea_4: "Sant'Andrea"

 JAI_idea_2: "Tas-Silg"
 JAI_idea_2_desc: "Tas-Silg is the name of a hill which commands Marsaxlokk Bay on the southern coast of Malta. It was the site of a Byzantine monastery which became heavily fortified in the eighth century due to the threat of Muslim raids."
 JAI_idea_3: "Arabic Influences"
 JAI_idea_3_desc: "The Maltese language is a curious one. About half its vocabulary is Italian, but another third is made up of Arabic, as is the grammatical structure. Though it is scarcely mutually intelligible with Maghrebi Arabic, the Islamic presence on the island is unforgettable and lives on to the present."
 JAI_idea_4: "Great Siege of Malta"
 JAI_idea_4_desc: "The 1565 siege of Malta by the Ottoman Empire is perhaps the most famous siege of the Early Modern west. 40,000 Ottoman troops under the pirate Dragut surrounded the island and spent three months trying to take its fortress, defended by the Knights Hospitaller's 6,000 men. The Knights' general Jean de Valette managed to withstand the siege against all odds, destroying the image of Ottoman invincibility and later getting the capital city named after himself. Voltaire once claimed 'nothing is better known than the siege of Malta.'"
 JAI_idea_5: "Noria"
 JAI_idea_5_desc: "The relatively brief period of Islamic rule in Malta produced a profound effect on the local agriculture, as irrigation infrastructure like waterwheels (noria) were created and new crops such as cotton, oranges, and lemons were planted."
 JAI_idea_6: "Ir-Rewwixta tal-Qassisin"
 JAI_idea_6_desc: "The 'Rising of the Priests' was an incident in 1775 when the clergy of Malta rose up against the decadent and declining Knights Hospitaller and took over two of the island's important forts, Fort Saint Elmo and Saint James Cavalier. Though it was put down, it proved the populace would not stand for tyranny and poverty."
 JAI_idea_7: "The Maltese Falcon"
 JAI_idea_7_desc: "Legend holds that in the 1500s, as a reward for the continued support of the King of Spain, the Knights Hospitaller created a solid-gold statue of a falcon encrusted with jewels.

Several times the counts of Armagnac outright defied the authority of the French king, including partaking in large scale rebellions against the house of Valois. These actions have earned us quite the reputation on the diplomatic scene."
 AMG_scattered_territories: "Scattered Territories"

The task of managing these lands has been a difficult one at times, but with the right administrative policies we can ensure they remain indivisible from our home territory."

Even now, these diplomatic strategies will only become more important to ensure the survival of our nation in the future."
 AMG_armagnac_faction: "The Armagnac Faction"
 AMG_armagnac_faction_desc: "During the time of the Hundred Years' War, the politics within France were dominated by two opposing factions, the Armagnacs and the Burgundians. This rivalry was exacerbated by events such as the assassination of the Armagnac-supporting Duke of Orleans in 1407. Tensions came to a head when the Duchy of Burgundy allied itself with the English, resulting in a bloody civil war. However during these times, the mercenary forces of the Armagnacs in particular showed their prowess on the field, and their tactics still remain with us today."

 FOI_dynastic_expansion_desc: "The county of Foix on its own is not a significant land to hold by any means, but thanks to the ambitious nature and skill of our previous rulers we have managed to enlarge our domains to encompass the viscounties of Bearn and Bigorre. Now that the titles of Bearn and Foix have been ruled together for so long, they have become practically synonymous with each other. Those who may otherwise believe our claims to these lands are false will be much less likely to question our legitimacy to them."
 FOI_mediators_of_war: "Mediators of War"
 FOI_mediators_of_war_desc: "Foix has seen itself embroiled in many a conflict across the ages, owing to its position on the border between two distinct cultures. Many counts of Foix fought in battles miles from their own land, as well as with local neighbours such as the Armagnacs. This has given us a unique role to play in the region as those who will not hesitate to intervene should tensions spill over."

 ETR_idea_1_desc: "Etruria takes its name from the ancient region of Etruria, inhabited in pre-Roman times by the Etruscan civilization. The Etruscans were rivals to Rome and stood as the dominant force in central Italy for centuries after Rome's foundation in 753 BC."
 ETR_idea_2: "Napoleonic Client"
 ETR_idea_2_desc: "Etruria was founded specifically by Napoléon Bonaparte as a client state of the French Empire. Our fate is tied to that of Revolutionary France and its invincible armies!"
 ETR_idea_3: "The Bourbon Dynasty"
 ETR_idea_3_desc: "Louis I de Bourbon was a duke of Parma when it was annexed by France and he was subsequently given rule over Etruria as compensation. He hailed from the famed Bourbon dynasty, kings of Spain and former kings of France as cadets of the original Capetians."
 ETR_idea_4: "Queen Maria Luisa"
 ETR_idea_4_desc: "Daughter of the King of Spain, Maria Luisa was the consort of the first Etrurian monarch Louis I and after his premature death in 1803 she exercised power in the kingdom on behalf of her infant son Charles. She reformed taxation and manufacturing, swelled the ranks of the army, and funded educational enterprises like the School of Science and the Museum of Physics."
 ETR_idea_5: "Florence"
 ETR_idea_5_desc: "The capital of the Kingdom of Etruria was, of course, Florence, which surpassed even other famed Tuscan cities like Pisa and Siena.

 ANC_idea_2: "Stamira"
 ANC_idea_2_desc: "The siege of 1173 was the most dramatic in Ancona's history. Surrender was almost guaranteed as a large Venetian fleet blockaded the port and an Imperial army under Christian of Mainz besieged the walls. However, a patriotic woman named Stamira sallied from the walls and sacrificed herself by lighting pitch on fire to rout the attackers."
 ANC_idea_3: "Adriatic Renaissance"
 ANC_idea_3_desc: "The Adriatic Sea saw close connections forged between major cities like Ancona, Venice, Zara, Ragusa, and Rimini. A rediscovery of classical art, fused with the existing Gothic style, characterized the so-called 'Adriatic Renaissance' which spread between these cities in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries."
 ANC_idea_4: "Republicanism"

 ARP_idea_2_desc: "Our nation is centered around the river Rhône, one of the most significant rivers of Europe. As a navigable river, the Rhône is crucial in connecting the Mediterranean with the major cities of Arpitania - Arles, Avignon, Valence, Vienne, Lyon, and Genève.

When the empire fell, the clever Arelat citizens converted the amphitheater into a fortress complete with houses and four watchtowers. The theater was, in effect, a tiny walled city."
 ARP_idea_4: "We Were Carolingians"
 ARP_idea_4_desc: "The roots of the Kingdom of Arles lay in the gavelkind successions of the Carolingian Franks. The Treaty of Prüm in 855 gave Arles to Charles of Provence, and in 879 Boso of Provence founded another kingdom in the region. These great Frankish kings are our ancestors!"

 BEA_idea_1_desc: "The powerful abbey of Cluny had territorial differences with the small local lords of the neighboring counts of Forez and Mâcon. The abbey, not even supported by the bishops of Mâcon and Lyon, sought support elsewhere and the counts of Beaujeu gave them their support and protection. And so they became military allies."
 BEA_idea_2: "Le Vignoble du Beaujolais"
 BEA_idea_2_desc: "The wine of Beaujolais is a world-renowned wine produced in the region named after the County of Beaujeu. Primarily red wines are produced here. The soil of the region is mostly granitic sand. The wine has a refined, very aromatic taste. There is an old and strong connection between the cuisine of Lyon and the Beaujolais, that had historically been exported a lot to the Lyon region, as the very fruited taste of the wine combines well with the local charcuterie."
 BEA_idea_3: "La Guerre entre Lyon et Beaujeu"
 BEA_idea_3_desc: "The Counts of Beaujeu once fought a war in 1289 against the Bishops of Lyon, which they had easily won, and left the Archbishopric in bad shape.

 BEA_idea_6: "La Bête du Lyonnais"
 BEA_idea_6_desc: "The beast of Lyon was an anthropophagic animal that committed a series of attacks against humans, usually children under 15 years old. The corpses were generally half-devoured. The first attack had been recorded in the summer of 1754, somewhere in the County of Beaujolais, suggesting that the animal came from here. The following attacks were usually located closer to Lyon. The animal, or animals, had made about 30 victims (and an unknown number of wounded) till the end of 1756.\n\nThe beast was usually described as a wolf, with less taller legs, a rougher fur and a multi-colored skin. Some thought it was a hyena, but the species hadn't been defined back then, and some thought this could've been a werewolf."
 BEA_idea_7: "Sell the Right to Hunt"
 BEA_idea_7_desc: "The Counts of Beaujeu, ruling over a well-forested area, sold the right to hunt to their inhabitants, and not only to the bourgeoisie, which greatly increased their income, as the farmers were eager to gain more meat and kill the animals who destroyed their vines, crops or cattle. And if more got produced, then more tax income could be created, so it was deemed to be a win-win situation."

Pope Gregory the Great gave the crown to the Langobard princess Theodelina and it has since then been housed in Monza Cathedral to be used for the coronation of Langobard Kings and the subsequent Frankish Kings of Italy."
 KLK_idea_2: "Alboino"
 KLK_idea_2_desc: "King Alboino of the Gausi dynasty was the first of the Lombard Kings to conquer Italy. Alboino had crossed the Julian Alps in 568 and quickly brought the major cities of present Lombardy under his control. The outraged Byzantine Empire organized a conspiracy with Alboino's wife and half-brother which successfully murdered him on June 28th 572, but the memory of Alboino lived on amongst the Germanic peoples and the conspirators were exiled rather than ascending to power as they had planned."
 KLK_idea_3: "Gastaldates"
 KLK_idea_3_desc: "The original Langobard Kingdom was elective rather than hereditary and was dominated by large Stem Duchies like the German Empire to its north. Each of these duchies was in turn divided into gastaldates, a special Langobard office headed by a gastald. Kings gave the gastalds judicial and martial administrative powers in each city, and the gastalds were thus often in conflict with the locally-autonomous dukes as agents of royal power."
 KLK_idea_4: "Edictum Rothari"
 KLK_idea_4_desc: "The Edictum Rothari, or Lombard Law, was promulgated in 643 AD by King Rotari under the guidance of a meeting called a Gairethinx.

The League as proof of the lasting Lombard identity and the Langobard spirit that unites us in defiance of foreign encroachment."
 KLK_idea_7: "Escaping the Empire"
 KLK_idea_7_desc: "Ever since Charlemagne crossed the Alps and ended the original Langobard Kingdom, Lombardy has been subject to the whims of the Frankish Holy Roman Empire. By the fifteenth century, however, extensive absenteeism by nominal Italian kings led to a collapse of Imperial authority and the region's escape from the Empire. We must embrace self-rule and take advantage of every opportunity we have to increase our autonomy."

El Cid came from a minor aristocratic family and first worked as a general for different Islamic Taifas before becoming the primary military leader of Castile-León and ultimately carving out his own independent state centered on València. His new realm was ruled with tolerance for Christians and Muslims alike, and greatly angered the Castilian King who had previously employed him. El Cid's wife continued to rule València after his death, leaving him immortalized in Spanish folk culture."

The Kingdom of the Algarve, for instance, was considered part of the Portuguese King's titles and even appeared separately on maps. These appanages were made most famous when the Count of Trastamara in Galicia, Enrique, managed to win the entire Castilian Crown in a rebellion and put his illegitimate line on the throne for centuries to come."

Guiscard was established as Count of Apulia in 1057 and quickly drove the Byzantines out of their remaining forts in Calabria and Salento, from which he began to reconquer Sicily from the Saracens for the first time in centuries. Under his rule, Latin Christianity spread through formerly Greek lands and such churches as Salerno Cathedral were founded."
 siculo_norman_idea_2: "Pilgrimage"
 siculo_norman_idea_2_desc: "The Normans first established their presence in Southern Italy, even before they began to work as mercenaries, by going on pilgrimages to Rome, Jerusalem, and Monte Gargano. According to the Salernitan Tradition, Norman pilgrims ridiculed the Lombards for paying Saracen ransom money and scared off Islamic pirates easily, which caused the Prince of Salerno to request their continued presence in the area for protection."

 siculo_norman_idea_3_desc: "Starting in the 1140s the Normans fully reversed the tide of Islamic conquests that had rocked Africa since the seventh century and put the Arab states there on the defensive. Many of the most important coastal fortresses in Tunisia fell into Norman hands, including the entire strategic island of Djerba, and these newly-conquered titles were quickly organized into a new Christian kingdom. Though it didn't last long, the Kingdom of Africa is a testament to Norman ambition and siege prowess."
 siculo_norman_idea_4: "Unite the Counties"
 siculo_norman_idea_4_desc: "When the Normans first conquered Southern Italy they divided it into hereditary counties and duchies distributed amongst various Norman families. These counties included Foggia, Bojano, Aversa, Capua, Lecce, Sicily, Malta, and many others. We should make an effort to annex these feudal titles to the crown and steer Southern Italy toward a more centralized bureaucratic system under a single noble family."
 siculo_norman_idea_5: "Greco-Arabic Influences"
 siculo_norman_idea_5_desc: "Through the process of encastellation, the Normans in Southern Italy developed a style which synthesized that of the Arabs and Byzantines who preceded them. In many cases Romanesque cathedrals and monasteries were build on lands that had only been converted from Islam and Orthodoxy immediately prior, and local talents were frequently employed."
 siculo_norman_idea_6: "French Connections"
 siculo_norman_idea_6_desc: "The Drengots and de Hautevilles had originally arrived in Italy from northern France and as such ties with the French nobility were maintained even centuries after the Norman conquest was completed. The Angevin rulers of Provence, for instance, eventually retook the Norman Kingdom of Sicily from its Germanic overlords and returned Southern Italy to French control. We are lucky to have dynastic and cultural ties to such a robust aristocracy."

 giudicati_idea_1_desc: "The Giudicato system was born out of Roman-Byzantine administrative institutions which decayed in the eighth century leading to Sardinian independence. The formerly Byzantine-appointed Archons became autonomous rulers of Sardinia, but unlike most Western feudal states their power was not absolute. Instead, the ancient traditions of the Nuragic culture of Sardinia fused with Byzantine practices to produce our unique governments."
 giudicati_idea_2: "Famiglia de Lacon"
 giudicati_idea_2_desc: "In late Byzantine Sardinia, the offices of Doux and Praeses were apparently held by a family from Laconi in Sarcidano and from Gunale in Arzachena respectively. At some point the families united into one, and when the island entered its Giudicato era each Giudicato was ruled by a branch of the family. Our dynastic ties are extensive, whether Lacon-Zori or Lacon-Gunale or Lacon-Serra."
 giudicati_idea_3: "Corona de Logu"
 giudicati_idea_3_desc: "The national assembly of each Giudicato was the Corona de Logu. This organization was made up of the aristocratic nobility and had to approve any action taken by the Giudice, nominally even having the power to elect a new Giudice in lieu of feudal inheritance. This system was codified in such documents as the 1392 Carta de Logu, and helps give the populace the illusion of checks and balances against autocracy."
 giudicati_idea_4: "Establish Curadorias"
 giudicati_idea_4_desc: "To better administer the mountainous lands of Sardinia and keep disparate villages under Giudicial authority, we should create the office of Curadora and divide each Giudicato into Curadorias. These districts will be controlled from a central village where the Curadore can execute government and local land management."
 giudicati_idea_5: "Bujakesos & Birridus"
 giudicati_idea_5_desc: "Constant piracy from Saracens and incursion from ambitious Italian states means the Sardinian Giudicati are used to warfare. Sardinia's elite soldiers were called bujakesos and carried a special weapon derived from the Roman javelin called a birrudu."
 giudicati_idea_6: "Romanesque Prestige"
 giudicati_idea_6_desc: "Due to our Byzantine ties, Sardinia developed under the auspices of Eastern Christianity and the Eastern Liturgy. However, starting at the schism of 1054, the Giudicati oriented themselves towards the Papacy and by 1092 had lost their autocephalous status. Western Monasticism spread throughout Sardinia starting with Barisone de Lacon's 1064 donation of Nostra Segnora de Mesumundu to the Benedictine Order. Later monks from the Cistercian Order, Camaldolese Order, Vallombrosian Order, and Vittorian Order arrived and Romanesque Architecture flourished at further churches like the Basilica di Saccargia and Basilica di San Gavino."
 giudicati_idea_7: "Arborean Resistance"
 giudicati_idea_7_desc: "Though most of the Giudicati fell to foreign powers - Pisa, Aragon, Genoa - by the end of the thirteenth century, Arborea managed to repel attempted invasion forces multiple times and in fact went on the offensive against Aragon throughout the 1300s, conquering virtually all of Sardinia from them. Through diplomatic maneuvering and the skill of generals like Brancaleone Doria, Arborea is an inspiration to Sardinians across the island."

 SIC_TAI_idea_2: "Splendor of Palermo"
 SIC_TAI_idea_2_desc: "It is hard to mention Sicily without also mentioning its shining jewel, the grand city of Palermo. The surrounding fields provide enough food, and more, for the entire city to eat. 4 springs give their water ensuring Palermo never succumbs to drought. Too many mosques to count dot the cityscape, almost every one also being a school and educating our populous. In its splendor Palermo is one of the largest cities in Europe."
 SIC_TAI_idea_3: "Agricultural Revolution"
 SIC_TAI_idea_3_desc: "When Islam came to Sicily, so did its agricultural expertise. Many scholars of the time specialized in agronomy and discovered many ways to more efficiently farm. This included: improved irrigation, proper caring for fruit trees including olive, efficient animal husbandry and many more."
 SIC_TAI_idea_4: "Byzantine Revolts"
 SIC_TAI_idea_4_desc: "Some former Byzantine citizens can't quite understand that Sicily is, and always shall be, Muslim. However they continuously revolt in petty attempts to restore the Byzantine tyrants. Over the years we have become skillful at squashing these revolts, sometimes before they happen."
 SIC_TAI_idea_5: "Independent From North Africa"
 SIC_TAI_idea_5_desc: "The North African Caliphs and Emirs often try to invade or rein in our autonomy. However they shall not succeed as the wealth of Sicily shall be none but its own! We shall triumph as we are not Berber or Arab but Sicilian!"
 SIC_TAI_idea_6: "Sunni in a Sea of Shia"
 SIC_TAI_idea_6_desc: "The Shia Fatimids attempted to bring us in and convert, but we resisted! When that did not work, they taxed us greatly attempting to exploit our great wealth, but we resisted! They murdered and pillaged, but we resisted! Eventually they succumbed and installed a separate dynasty for us, a Sunni one."
 SIC_TAI_idea_7: "Norman Threat"
 SIC_TAI_idea_7_desc: "As the dust of Byzantine Italy settles, a new foe emerges in its ashes. The Norman duchy of Apulia may have dominated the rest of Southern Italy, but if they think they will set a foot on our island, we will chop it off!"

 HDS_ideas_bonus: "Hildesheimer Ambition"
 HDS_idea_1: "Damned Dammstadt"
 HDS_idea_1_desc: "Dammstadt, located not too far from Hildesheim, grew from Hildesheimer trade. The city became increasingly powerful, gaining city rights, city walls and a real market place. It even started making new settlements; the city was a real economic competitor and most annoyingly, it was trying to influence the elections in Hildesheim. It became a real threat in the eyes of the Bishops. In 1331-1332, a double election happened, where the candidate supported by Dammstadt was ousted, and his successor prompted an attack against Dammstadt on Christmas Eve 1332, in which it got looted and mostly destroyed. The remains of the city were integrated into the city of Hildesheim."
 HDS_idea_2: "Innerste Ford"
 HDS_idea_2_desc: "The city of Hildesheim, one of the oldest in Northern Germany, had an important market on the Hellweg trade route, as it secured the Innerste ford. The fact that the city had a cathedral, and an important market, made it grow to be one of the largest cities in Northern Germany in 1250. The first market place was laid out around the church St. Andreas. When the city grew further, a bigger market place became necessary."
 HDS_idea_3: "Tausendjähriger Rosenstock"
 HDS_idea_3_desc: "The Tausendjähriger Rosenstock, or Thousand-year Rose, is a rosa canina that climbs on the wall of Hildesheim Cathedral. It is probably the rose mentioned in a legend in the Fundatio Ecclesiae Hildensemens, an 11th-century publication. The Emperor had taken a reliquary to use when he stopped to say Mass while out hunting. The artefact was placed in a tree while the sermon was undertaken but not retrieved when the hunt resumed. Later a chaplain was unable to remove the reliquary from the branches. Believing this to be a symbol of God's will, the Emperor had a church constructed there instead of as originally planned at Elze."
 HDS_idea_4: "High Reputation Cathedral Chapter"
 HDS_idea_4_desc: "The reputation of the cathedral chapter and school was such that Hildesheim produced no fewer than forty-four bishops and archbishops, who served in dioceses from Cologne to Magdeburg and from Schleswig to Salzburg and Brixen, between 918 and 1167."
 HDS_idea_5: "Flourishing in the Ottonian Era"
 HDS_idea_5_desc: "Hildesheim gained a lot of power and prosperity during the Ottonian era. A cultural revival spurred, as sovereigns and bishops, seeking the prestige of the Roman and Byzantine empires, vigorously supported the production of art, especially illuminated manuscripts and their jeweled covers, fine metalwork, and other luxury church furnishings. It was under the Ottonian kings that Hildesheim was elevated to the dynasty's home bishopric, and the proximity to them brought the Bishops numerous privileges, including the right to mint coinage. It is during this period that medieval Hildesheim produced a massive amount of art."
 HDS_idea_6: "Hildesheim Diocesan Feud"
 HDS_idea_6_desc: "The Hildesheim Diocesan Feud was a conflict that broke out between Hildesheim and Brunswick. Due to the Prince-Bishopric's poor financial circumstances he asked for the return of several estates pledged to the nobles within the realm but some of them refused to give up their mortgaged property. The ruler of Brunswick sought a reason to attack neighboring Hildesheim and found one in the disputes between the prince-bishop and the nobility; thus he started a war. Hildesheim won a major battle at Soltau that could've made them win the war, but the Emperor, favoring Brunswick, used its influence and Hildesheim had to give up a lot of territory. They perhaps won militarily, but not politically."
 HDS_idea_7: "Hildesheimer Treasure"
 HDS_idea_7_desc: "The Hildesheim Treasure, unearthed on October 17 1868 in Hildesheim by Prussian soldiers, is the largest collection of Roman silver found outside imperial frontiers. Most of it can be dated to the 1st century AD, and was probably produced in frontier workshops of the Northwestern Roman provinces. The trove consists of about seventy exquisitely crafted solid silver vessels for eating and drinking. It is generally believed that the treasure was the table service of a Roman commander, perhaps Publius Quintilius Varus, who was militarily active in Germania. However, others also suggest that the treasure may have been war spoils rather than a table service."

 BML_ideas_bonus: "Lübecker Ambition"
 BML_idea_1: "Ravaged Lands"
 BML_idea_1_desc: "In the Middle Ages, this region had been ravaged many times by for example the Rani. The original seat of Lübeck was even named after this: it received from the Northern Germanic Vikings the name of Brandenhuse or 'the burned houses'. The original city of Lübeck, Liubice (the lovely), had also been burned down during these times."
 BML_idea_2: "Bishop in Search of Crusaders and the Logistical Port of Lübeck"
 BML_idea_2_desc: "Lübeck was the largest German port on the Baltic Sea, and served an important logistical role during the Crusades in the Baltic lands. It not only transported many troops and supplies, but also numerous colonists, becoming also an import emigration port.\nMeanwhile the Bishop travelled to many places in Germany and the Baltic area. The purpose of these journeys was the recruiting of crusaders, usually through preaching."
 BML_idea_3: "Take over the Lübecker Trade"
 BML_idea_3_desc: "The Free City of Lübeck is the leading city in the Hanseatic trade. We should aim to get our namesake city back, and keep its wealthy trade intact. Therefore it is important to already have a considerable foothold in this trade network."
 BML_idea_4: "The Cathedral of Lübeck"
 BML_idea_4_desc: "The mighty cathedral of Lübeck had been constructed when the Bishops still resided in the city. After becoming a Free City, it still remained in the hands of the Bishop, but the provost was alternately chosen by the cathedral chapter and by the city council. It symbolizes the good relations both had."
 BML_idea_5: "Only Protestant Bishopric"
 BML_idea_5_desc: "Lübeck became one of the two only Prince-Bishoprics with a Protestant ruler in the Empire, the other being Osnabrück. However, Osnabrück was only alternately led by Protestant and Catholic bishops, meaning that Lübeck was the only full Protestant bishopric. Since this Prince of the Empire could not sit on the spiritual or temporal bench at the Reichstag, it received its own cross-wise bench."
 BML_idea_6: "Coincidence?"
 BML_idea_6_desc: "Originally, the seat of this diocese was located in Oldenburg in Holstein. Because of Slavic Tribes, the bishops were for a long time not able to enter their diocese. However, when these territories were added to the Holy Roman Empire, the seat of this diocese was moved to Lübeck.\nWhen Lübeck became a Free City, the seat moved again, this time to Eutin.\nSince 1586, after the conversion to Protestantism, all elected Bishops were members of the Holstein-Gottorp line of the House of Oldenburg. Eventually Lübeck became mediatized and became part of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, which was named after its capital, Oldenburg."
 BML_idea_7: "Danish Succession War for Lübeck"
 BML_idea_7_desc: "Although a small state, the Diocese comprised the Holstein-Schleswiger lands, over which the Danes had fought many conflicts. Not having the spiritual control over the lands was a thorn in their side, even more since this Oldenburger-Holsteiner family constantly ruled here, and it even became a kind of law that the bishop was of this family. This made it impossible to have a bishop loyal to the Danes here. When the Bishop died, the Danes started a succession war, which they eventually lost thanks to the intervention of England."
#Colditz

 CDZ_idea_1: "Colditz Castle"
 CDZ_idea_1_desc: "The most striking feature of the Lordship of Colditz was its castle, built on a cliff near a river, and this building played a huge role in the history of the town. It became the residence of the House of Colditz. The castle had been attacked, burned down and rebuilt several times in its history."
 CDZ_idea_2: "Cholidistcha"
 CDZ_idea_2_desc: "The first record of Colditz dates from 1046, when it was mentioned as a burgward on the Mulde called Cholidischa. Burgwards were a form of settlement used for the organization of the northeastern marches against the Saxons and other peoples. A burgward was composed of a central fortification, the burg, and a number of smaller, undefended villages, the wards, that depended on the burg for protection, and the burg was economically dependent on them. The burg was also the administrative center, for example used for tax collection. It was also given a garrison of cavalry, usually of Slavic origin."
 CDZ_idea_3: "Pleissenland"
 CDZ_idea_3_desc: "Pleissenland was a large, rather unexploited area with only a few towns that was in the possession of the Emperors. Colditz, strategically located in that area, had gotten special rights to make the lands arable and also to defend the place with its castle. The great efforts of the emperors to develop these lands resulted in an imperial territory that was covered with young villages, towns and monasteries."
 CDZ_idea_4: "Münzstätte Colditz"
 CDZ_idea_4_desc: "Already in the 13th century, Colditz was known for producing one-sided badges, and in the 14th century the town received the rights from the emperor to mint coins. Later, the emperor reaffirmed the right to mint and the ownership of the coins by the Lords of Colditz. The Lords probably operated a silver mine at Ulrichsberg, near Pegau."
 CDZ_idea_5: "Margarethengroschen"
 CDZ_idea_5_desc: "The so-called Margarethengroschen were a series of (illegal) coins minted at Colditz, ordered by Margaretha, the wife of the elector of Saxony. She had the right to mint there back then. The first coins she made quickly led to a dispute, as they had her initial before that of her husband; the sequence got changed, so that now the elector appeared as the mint master. Strangely enough, at these times she was also minting coins without the special mint mark, which could lead to someone interpreting her as being an illegal coin master. She also dared to make coins with only her initials. The right to mint was reconfirmed for her, just before the death of her husband, which gave her the possibility to mint even after his death."
 CDZ_idea_6: "Development of Manufacturing"
 CDZ_idea_6_desc: "In the 17th century, cloth and linen manufacturing became important in Colditz. In the 18th century, the clay from the Colditz area started to be used in the Meissen porcelain factory, and later a ceramics factory was established in Colditz."
 CDZ_idea_7: "Other Uses of the Castle"
 CDZ_idea_7_desc: "In 1803, the castle was used as a workhouse to feed the poor, sick and and people under arrest. From 1829 onwards, it served as a mental hospital until 1924. There was during these times there was also a sanatorium for the rich present. The Nazis converted the castle to a high-security prison, which is perhaps the period the castle has been most famous for. Although it was considered a high security prison, it had one of the greatest records of successful escape attempts. This could be owing to the general nature of the prisoners that were sent there; most of them had attempted escape previously from other prisons and were transferred to Colditz because the Germans had thought the castle escape-proof."

 KBA_idea_2: "Modus Indorum"
 KBA_idea_2_desc: "The genius of the Hindu number and mathematical structure has been present within the Islamic world for centuries. However, until recently they were unknown to Europe. Our bustling port and proximity to Italy allowed the mathematician Fibonacci to bring them to Europe. He would call them 'Modus Indorum', the methods of the Indians."

 KBA_idea_4: "Barbary Stronghold"
 KBA_idea_4_desc: "Bejaia's port may be home to many well-stocked trade ships, but it is also home to the Barbary pirates. They pillage and plunder many trade vessels but as long as they 'contribute' some of their earnings, we can look the other way."

 WDK_idea_1: "Waldecker Mercenaries"
 WDK_idea_1_desc: "In 1681, Waldeck started with renting out troops as mercenaries, which was back then only one infantry battalion. Quickly, more and more battalions were hired out. These mercenaries were for example used during the American War of Independence and the Napoleonic Wars. Waldeck also provided the Prussian army with a regiment during the Franco-Prussian War which got nicknamed Das Eiserne Regiment, or the Iron Regiment."
 WDK_idea_2: "Friends Repay Debts"

 WDK_idea_3: "Donate Arolsen Monastery to Hesse"
 WDK_idea_3_desc: "As a sign of trust and friendship, we donated the monastery of Arolsen, which is located near our capital, to the Counts of Hesse. They have made the monastery, as a sign of respect and piety, one of the wealthiest in the area. It has a notable brewery."
 WDK_idea_4: "August-Markt"
 WDK_idea_4_desc: "Waldeck's economy was focused on the exploitation of the woods, and on fields and livestock. The town of Arolsen became a very important place to sell all these goods. It gained the right to have three markets, and in the course of time a large annual market with many market stalls and a lot of cattle, the August-Markt, was also held in Arolsen."
 WDK_idea_5: "Garrison Town"
 WDK_idea_5_desc: "The capital of Waldeck, Arolsen, was well known as a garrison town. When the troops of Waldeck were not rented to some foreign power, they resided in this city. In later periods, the barracks had grown and had given places to house the soldiers of other foreign countries. For example Belgium had for a long time a garrison here."
 WDK_idea_6: "The Pyrmont Inheritance"
 WDK_idea_6_desc: "Due to the line of the counts of Gleichen dying out, the small country of Pyrmont was inherited by the Counts of Waldeck, who called themselves from then on the Counts of Waldeck-Pyrmont. Pyrmont was very well known for its natural hot springs, and this geothermally heated water was used for therapeutic baths, hence why the city is also called Bad Pyrmont."
 WDK_idea_7: "Christian August Prinz zu Waldeck"
 WDK_idea_7_desc: "Christian August Prinz zu Waldeck was an officer of the Austrian army who climbed in rank during his career to the ranks of general and field marshal. He played a major role in the Austro-Prussian army during the war with Revolutionary France.

 VIV_idea_1: "Tumultuous Religious History"
 VIV_idea_1_desc: "Starting with the Crusades against the Cathars, the Vivarais suffered from a lot of religious aggression and wars. With the outbreak of the Reformation, many people changed faiths, influenced by the nearby located center of Genève. This led again to troubles, mainly during the revolt of the Calvinists against Louis XVII, in which the important Vivarais city of Privas was burned to the ground. And when the Edict of Nantes was revoked by Louis XIV, the Dragonnades caused many non-Catholics to flee. The war of the Camisards, a revolt of Huguenots, caused even more damage."
 VIV_idea_2: "Haut-Vivarais"
 VIV_idea_2_desc: "The Haut-Vivarais is the highest part of the Vivarais, consisting of many grasslands and forests on rocky, old volcanic plateaus. It's a harsh environment, dry and rather windy during the summer, cold and snowy during the winter, and foggy during fall and spring. These lands have long been used by hardy shepherds."
 VIV_idea_3: "Les Châtaignerais du Vivarais"
 VIV_idea_3_desc: "The very nutrient-rich chestnuts are being cultivated for over 4000 years, completely shaping the landscape and the culture in the Vivarais. It was used as a substitute for grain, as grain could not fare well on the slopes of the region. The chestnuts of this region heavily influenced the French cuisine, especially with the popular marron glacé, as the Ardèchois chestnuts are the sweetest in the world. Also, since these nuts were collected during fall, people had more time for other jobs during spring and summer."
 VIV_idea_4: "Support from Local Barons"
 VIV_idea_4_desc: "Several local barons, like the one of Joannas, supported the Bishop in its sovereignty of the region, promising to help militarily if necessary. The Bishop also was constantly seeking to preserve the independence of Vivarais, and managed for example to regain lost lands from Toulouse. However, it remained very weak and couldn't compete against Lyon, Provence or France, and to make things worse, the emperor was too weak to guarantee our independence."
 VIV_idea_5: "La Sériculture en Ardèche"
 VIV_idea_5_desc: "With the arrival of the Popes in Avignon in the early 14th century, the mulberry, whose leaves are eaten by the silk caterpillars, was introduced in the region. As it was sufficiently warm here to grow these plants, people started to cultivate their own silk, and the Vivarais became the most important silk-producing region of France. Because of a severe winter in 1709, the traditional production (olives and chestnuts) was destroyed, increasing the need to find other incomes like the sériculture.\nDuring the 1800s, the mulberry trees suffered from various diseases, and the imported seeds provided only a short-term solution. Eventually the diseases were under control, but it didn't avoid the collapse of this sector."
 VIV_idea_6: "Fortified Villages"
 VIV_idea_6_desc: "There are many fortified villages in the region, called Bastides. The rivers and the slopes made it even more difficult to capture the cities. Balazuc, Largentière and Rochemaure are some examples of villages that could withstand sieges very well. All the buildings were almost completely built of stone, something most people in Europe could not afford; this made the villages very fire-proof."
 VIV_idea_7: "La Mine d'Argent de Largentière"
 VIV_idea_7_desc: "The village of Largentière had been for a long time an important industrious town. It was known, and named after, its silver mines. These did not give pure silver, but provided galena (in French called silverized lead). Lead was long used to make bullets, and silver is a precious metal."

 MUF_idea_4: "Protestant Stronghold"
 MUF_idea_4_desc: "As in other Alsatian cities, in the 16th century there was an anti-Walhaz attitude in Münster, because Walhaz were Catholics and Francophones at the same time.

 LTB_idea_2_desc: "The office of the bailiff of Strassburg, which the Lichtenberg family had held since 1249, has been increasingly undermined over the years by the city's citizens. The Lichtenbergers let the citizens buy most of the rights associated with it, so that the office became more and more symbolic.

The former was achieved by purchasing various castles in the vicinity of the ancestral castle, the latter only incompletely: The Lichtenberg estate could never grow together into a closed territory."
 LTB_idea_5: "Peace Within the Family"
 LTB_idea_5_desc: "A divided state of lordship always holds the potential of disintegration and conflict within the family.

 SSF_idea_4: "Great Power of the Guilds"
 SSF_idea_4_desc: "The patriciate had to accept a serious deprivation of power after the revolts of the craftsmen in 1482: The new constitution, which applied until the French Revolution, granted two thirds of seats in the city council to the guilds."
 SSF_idea_5: "Center of Book Production"
 SSF_idea_5_desc: "After Johannes Gutenberg invented letterpress printing in Europe, Strassburg quickly became an important center of book production. The Strassburger printers made an important contribution to the spread of the Reformation, because thanks to the far-reaching religious tolerance of the city, the writings of Martin Luther and other reformers could be published here already early. One third of the writings printed in the 16th century were bibles or excerpts from them."

 VNN_idea_2_desc: "In the year of 569, after the collapse of the Roman Empire, Verona was conquered by Alboin, King of the Lombards, and transformed into perhaps the second-most vital city within his realms; the Lombards would ultimately come to conquer much of the Italian peninsula, becoming the first to do so after the Romans."
 VNN_idea_3: "Veronese League"
 VNN_idea_3_desc: "In 1164 Verona joined with the cities of Vicenza, Padua, and Treviso to create the Veronese League, which would later combine with the larger Lombard league to defeat the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.

 VLK_idea_4_desc: "Valencia was built by the Romans in days that are now long gone. If we study the techniques used by the Romans in building this city, then we can implement them into our building stratagem and lessen our expenditures."
 VLK_idea_5: "Mediterranean Leverage"
 VLK_idea_5_desc: "The merchants of Valencia, renowned throughout the entire Mediterranean, have always been a mixed group of people, including Berbers, Christians, Franks, Jews, and many others. This diversity and renown gives us leverage in Eastern Iberian and general European trade."

 MBK_idea_2: "Mosbacher Palace"
 MBK_idea_2_desc: "The beginnings of the palace in Mosbach as a fortified castle probably go back to the Staufer period. The manor house existed even before Otto I made Mosbach a residence and was considerably extended by the Palatine counts in the 15th century with new buildings. The castle served the Heidelberger Electors as a refuge from epidemics several times, because even then Mosbach, unlike Heidelberg, was off the main travel routes."

 DSD_idea_2_desc: "In 1330, Emperor Louis the Bavarian granted Count Wilhelm I von Katzenelnbogen the city rights for Darmstadt. With the associated market rights, the importance of the previously rather inconspicuous settlement grew rapidly and the entire economy in the surrounding area focused on the Darmstadt market, while Darmstadt itself focused on the older and larger cities of Frankfurt, Worms and Speyer."
 DSD_idea_3: "Two City Centers"
 DSD_idea_3_desc: "In the middle of the 13th century the counts of Katzenelnbogen built a moated castle near Darmstadt. In defence, knights gradually settled south of the castle. Since the original peasant population lived east of the castle, two settlement cores formed separated from the Darmbach river, which were originally also administered separately."
 DSD_idea_4: "Katzenelnbogener Secondary Residence"
 DSD_idea_4_desc: "In the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, the Counts of Katzenelnbogen repeatedly extended and rebuilt the castle until it finally became a prestigious castle in the middle of the 15th century. Darmstadt became the Katzenelnbogener secondary residence and experienced a first high phase of its development."
 DSD_idea_5: "Ackerbürgerstadt Till 1695"

 DSD_idea_6: "Compulsory Schooling Since 1590"
 DSD_idea_6_desc: "During the reign of George I of Hesse-Darmstadt, Darmstadt experienced positive times and was spared from wars. As a result, the city's economy, prosperity and population grew rapidly. He made school attendance a prerequisite for the confirmation and thus introduced de facto compulsory school attendance."
 DSD_idea_7: "Enlightenment Within Absolutism"
 DSD_idea_7_desc: "During the reign of Ernst Ludwig of Hesse-Darmstadt, numerous political reforms were carried out in Darmstadt during the first half of the 18th century.

Among the Salian and Hohenstaufen emperors, the Speyer bishops and students of the cathedral school increasingly assumed the role of governors and functionaries of the empire. Speyer seemed to take on the character of a royal city or imperial city."
 BMS_idea_2: "Speyer Cathedral"
 BMS_idea_2_desc: "The Salian king and later Emperor Conrad II had the cathedral built around 1025 with the aim of building the largest church in the Occident. After its consecration in 1061, the cathedral included a western building, a nave with three aisles and a transept. The choir was flanked by two towers. Almost 20 years after its completion, Henry IV had half of the cathedral demolished in order to rebuild it even larger."
 BMS_idea_3: "Ecclesiastical Immunity"
 BMS_idea_3_desc: "For a long time, the increase in power of the bishops of Speyer knew no end. Otto the Great granted Speyer the immunity privilege, his own jurisdiction and control over coins and customs. As a result, the counts retired as a power factor in the city and Speyer finally fell under the protection, control and rule of the bishops. With the right to mint coins, Speyer developed into one of the most important minting places in the empire by the 12th century."
 BMS_idea_4: "Location on the Rhine"
 BMS_idea_4_desc: "Of great importance for Speyer's development was its favorable location on the Rhine, a central Central European traffic artery. The immediate proximity to the river on the flood-safe high bank was an advantage, as was the nearby mouth of the Neckar valley into the Rhine plain, which established the connection to the southeast in the direction of the Danube, and the proximity of the Kaiserslautern valley, which switched traffic to the west and southwest."
 BMS_idea_5: "Speyergau"
 BMS_idea_5_desc: "Speyergau was a county of the Salians, which extended to the surroundings of the city of Speyer. The Salians are considered the second founders of Speyer; with them the city moved into the center of imperial politics and became the spiritual center of Salian kingship. With the election of Conrad II as German King the targeted promotion of the city and church began, which was also continued by the Staufer family."
 BMS_idea_6: "Birthplace of Ashkenazic culture"
 BMS_idea_6_desc: "In the Middle Ages, Worms, Mainz and Speyer were praised as Rhenish Jerusalem because of the spiritual charisma of the flourishing Jewish communities there. They were of formative importance for Western European Jewry and are therefore regarded as the birthplace of Ashkenazic culture."
 BMS_idea_7: "Metropolis Germaniae"

 Speyer_idea_1: "Drapery Trade"
 Speyer_idea_1_desc: "The main pillar of the economy was cloth production and trade, on which about 15% of the population depended.

The cloth export went to the North and Baltic Sea, Silesia, Transylvania and Switzerland."
 Speyer_idea_2: "Big Freedom Letter"
 Speyer_idea_2_desc: "On the day his father was buried in Speyer Cathedral in 1111, Henry V granted the city further privileges. The Great Freedom Charter was the first city in Germany to grant citizens personal freedoms, and the granting of these citizens' privileges marked the beginning of the development into a free imperial city. This letter became a model for other cities in the empire. What became clear for the first time with these privileges was the developing interest of the empire in strengthening the bourgeoisie as a counterweight to episcopal power."
 Speyer_idea_3: "City Council Conspiracies"
 Speyer_idea_3_desc: "The second half of the 14th century was dominated by rivalries between influential Speyern families, which led to armed conflicts and conspiracies.

 Speyer_idea_5: "Protestation at Speyer"
 Speyer_idea_5_desc: "The protestation at Speyer in 1529 by the Protestant princes against the decision of the Reichstag was a world-historically significant event in Speyer: even if this protest was only a legal act for the time being, it sealed the separation of the Christian Church of Western Europe. The Protestation of the princes and cities is regarded as the birth of Protestantism and since then the followers of the Reformation movement have been called Protestants."

 LEM_idea_7_desc: "The Latin Empire was a bastion of Catholicism in a sea of despicable heresies and dangerous heathenry.

 KGG_idea_2_desc: "In 1347, the Habsburgs granted Ulrich I the administrative office of Landvogt over the Area of Upper Swabia. This office persisted until the death of the old Holy Roman Empire.

 KGG_idea_4: "Rothenfels Purchase"
 KGG_idea_4_desc: "In 1565, Johann Jakob von Königsegg purchased Rothenfels off of his brother-in-law. This added substantially to his realm, and therefore the successful and peaceful acquisition of this land led to better treatment from local counties and abbacies."

 KGG_idea_5_desc: "In 1622, Königsegg split into Königsegg-Aulendorf and Königsegg-Rothenfels. As a result of this, regions under the house of Königsegg became more able to think independently, since the rulers were separate."

They met at the Marburg Colloquy and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. The Reformation spread but some cantons remained Catholic which lead to the religious wars of Kappel."

 ANJ_idea_1: "Only True Heir"
 ANJ_idea_1_desc: "We, the dukes of Anjou, are directly related to the powerful Angevin dynasty. There are many who claim this honor, but we own this very hinterland, the theoretical heart of the empire. While the medieval age may pass, the age of dynastic empires never will."
 ANJ_idea_2: "Realm of Diversity"
 ANJ_idea_2_desc: "Our home dynasty once united such varied cultures from across Europe that the wisest men could not speak even half of the languages spoken in the Angevin kingdom and duchies. Each of the Angevins had to adapt.

 ANJ_idea_3: "Legacy of Dynastic Conflicts"
 ANJ_idea_3_desc: "It is not easy to persuade people into fighting for succession, since most of the common folk do not care about from where their suzerain comes, until he decides to close up with them - but this can be made only after winning said war! When we are in need of regular armies, we have an advantage though: Italian condottieri, Hungarian riders, French raubritters, and even Gallowglasses from the British Isles are at our disposal... Not cheaply though. However, we have some experience in gaining lower prices, since dynastic conflicts of our dynasty tormented Europe for nearly 200 years."
 ANJ_idea_4: "Advanced Dynastic Management"
 ANJ_idea_4_desc: "Once upon a time the king of Bohemia Václav III fought with Charles Robert d'Anjou for the Crown of St. Stephen. Then, he was murdered. Although some evidence we maintain proves that the assassin was a little chubby girl trained from childhood to be a professional killer, we must admit that she created a great advantage for us and she deserved a cookie. We shall call the art of monarch elimination 'Advanced Dynastic Management' and teach it to our spies abroad, to help us in incoming dynastic struggles. Even if we don't murder anybody along the way, spying efficiency will rise."
 ANJ_idea_5: "Apocalypse Tapestry"
 ANJ_idea_5_desc: "Our proud heritage of cultural supremacy is best marked by enormous tapestry presenting the end of all times, once commissioned by duke Louis. When a story is so terrifying, enlarging it to hundreds of feet of artfully-woven cloth results in inevitable shock and obedience to the will of God Himself. And who is the man chosen by the Lord's will to rule these lands? Yes, that's right... you. No man will flinch on the battlefield when they know obedience to the duke is obedience to a powerful God, and whoever dies will be resurrected right after the Dies Irae he saw on the tapestry."
 ANJ_idea_6: "Chateaux of Loire Valley"
 ANJ_idea_6_desc: "Among abundant fields of artichoke and asparagus, vineyards, and berry bushes stand, like white mountains shading the Loire valley, simultaneously mighty and delicate chateaux. In those palace-fortresses dwells the elite of our glorious country. They can be proud of their homes, since their castles shine with the splendor of the Renaissance on all Europe."
 ANJ_idea_7: "Tuffeau"
 ANJ_idea_7_desc: "Those chateaux we may boast about are beautiful for a reason - they are built using tuffeau: light, radiant stone that continues to impress foreigners when they see villages of it, bathed in sunlight. Expanded stone-mining industry makes it easier for us to lower construction costs, although I believe it is the pleasure of working with such wonderful material which makes buildings cheaper."
#Hiberno-Norman
 HiberNor_ideas: "Hiberno-Norman Ideas"
 HiberNor_ideas_start: "Hiberno-Norman Traditions"
 HiberNor_ideas_bonus: "Hiberno-Norman Ambition"
 HiberNor_idea_1: "Invaders in Decline"
 HiberNor_idea_1_desc: "What is happening now might be the end of our dominance in Eire. Following Strongbow, we almost conquered and civilized this island - but lack of support from Britain was one of many reasons for our failure. If we are to at least keep our current position, we have to prepare for conflict, and the best way to do this is keeping trust in the prime source of Norman success: mounted knights."
 HiberNor_idea_2: "Gaelic Assimilation"
 HiberNor_idea_2_desc: "It rarely happens that new settlers don't accept parts of the neighboring culture as their own, and they often even adopt their way of life and language, especially if your neighbors have some hearty jigs. It may be possible we are not real strangers anymore, but the same folk as the Irish; and while some say we became 'more Irish than the Irish themselves' we are proud of our mixed heritage."
 HiberNor_idea_3: "Tower Houses"
 HiberNor_idea_3_desc: "Invaders are never welcome, and so we were. Our first manors had to be tiny fortresses. Although in the incoming age of gunpowder they have no use in real warfare, they will effectively nip any attempts of local rebellions in the bud."
 HiberNor_idea_4: "Legacy of Conquests"
 HiberNor_idea_4_desc: "Irishmen who perceived us as Englishmen would be shocked if they knew how many cultures we have assimilated into: French, Anglo-Saxon, Sicilian, Greek, perhaps even Arabian in some time. Such was the energy of our ancestors, they've left their influence all over the world. We have plenty of states where we can search for common ground and understanding."
 HiberNor_idea_5: "Feudal Emissaries"
 HiberNor_idea_5_desc: "The English have allegedly brought the Irish a more 'civilized' form of government by establishing feudalism. Former counties were split into so-called cantreds. Although our assimilated culture has turned this feudalism into a more clan-like form, we have a great advantage in terms of connection with numerous subjects and eventual lieges."
 HiberNor_idea_6: "Statutes of Kilkenny"
 HiberNor_idea_6_desc: "Attempts of turning our culture back to 'proper' English haven't succeeded, as the Crown didn't have enough power to enforce them. Right now, however, the Crown has no power at all and we are vulnerable to enemy invasions. The only useful thing we could bring out from these Statutes is advice to train more of our settlers in traditional English fighting sports like archery or lancing, so that more citizens of our realm will have the opportunity to effectively stand in defence of our homeland."
 HiberNor_idea_7: "Settlement Experience"
 HiberNor_idea_7_desc: "As with most states that relied heavily on settlers, we have much experience in arranging for more potential folks coming to the wild land just around the corner. After all, our hearts may be Irish, but our minds and bodies still serve the English purpose!"

 CrusaderS_idea_1: "From Papal Afflatus"
 CrusaderS_idea_1_desc: "We have come here to save the holiest of places from heretic hands, inspired by the Pope and his wise words. If someone obeyed His Holiness to such a degree, how can he and his heirs not be the most important dukes in the Christian world?"
 CrusaderS_idea_2: "Another Crusaders' Kings"
 CrusaderS_idea_2_desc: "Great names like Godefroid de Bouillon or Guy de Lusignan are, unfortunately, relics of the past: times are changing, and we don't need either feudal scrambles or brave knights in shining armor, which are so easy to shoot through! We will do away with the old order, but never overlook the need for a large number of sons: all their bad traits and flaws seemingly lose any meaning, and there will be no problem with having many children: local maids are swarthy and voluptuous..."
 CrusaderS_idea_3: "Outremer Trade"
 CrusaderS_idea_3_desc: "Silk! Spices! Fruits, pistachios, nuts, almonds, dates! Vanillas, mmh, yes, sweet vanillas! WINE! MORE WINE! By God Almighty, everything so fresh, so tasty, so shiny and beautiful! Trade with Venice and Genoa is profitable enough that if I were to give one florin to a beggar for each ten thousand florins some merchant gains, he would be rich by midnight! Let us profit from this, for there is no other way to India that through the East! Those foolish Portuguese, how can they think they can sail south and find passage there? Nay, nay, there are monsters there! Dumb Iberians..."
 CrusaderS_idea_4: "Dry Wells"
 CrusaderS_idea_4_desc: "When you reach the countryside, everything is dry, as sand or my head this morning. Often even wells in abandoned villages are dry, and pity on he who encounters such a well during his march. It is critical for us to secure water supplies and be ready for future campaigns against the heretics."
 CrusaderS_idea_5: "Crusader Marines"
 CrusaderS_idea_5_desc: "Italian mercenary fleets we hired to reach Constantinople were often ill suited for fighting. We should create our own armadas, and embark them with some of the greatest warriors mankind has ever seen. Those will be Crusader Marines, and they shall know no fear!"
 CrusaderS_idea_6: "Ordos Militans"
 CrusaderS_idea_6_desc: "He who has piety in his heart, sword in his hand, blue blood in his veins, dust in his chest and a tiny swathe of land should join a militant order and sacrifice his life for the greater good, fighting heathen and heretic. He would best do this job, however, by simply becoming an officer, inspiring and introducing his men to strict monastic discipline. If we manage to get a whole cadre of these officers, our armies would become unstoppable."
 CrusaderS_idea_7: "Brothers in Faith"
 CrusaderS_idea_7_desc: "Everyone wants to be saved, but not everyone can or will crusade overseas. So, through giving us gifts, military backup, or filthy lucre they get what they want. The notion that we are the guardians of our Lord's footsteps creates a worldwide reputation of us as honest (hah!), proud men, which is beneficial for our diplomatic look, not only among grateful brothers in faith. Put the chicken wings down and come crusade, bro."
#Toulouse
 TOU_ideas: "Toulousian Ideas"
 TOU_ideas_start: "Toulousian Traditions"
 TOU_ideas_bonus: "Toulousian Ambition"
 TOU_idea_1: "Visigothic Capital"
 TOU_idea_1_desc: "Toulouse was once a capital of the vast kingdom of the Visigoths, who embraced the Arian faith and made ground in what is now called France. We are proud dukes of the place where modern history formed, and we should strive to have as many men as possible to recreate ancient empires."
 TOU_idea_2: "Spanish March"
 TOU_idea_2_desc: "Similarly to Champagne, we also were an independent country, located on what was once the so-called Marca Hispanica of the Frankish Empire. Beyond the Pyrenees, Arabic invaders could always find prepared fortresses, assembled troops, and battle-hardened people. To a second Tours!"
 TOU_idea_3: "Center of Occitania"
 TOU_idea_3_desc: "Our county is indisputably the birthplace of high and sophisticated Occitan culture. We would clearly be the foremost in arts and science - if not for corrupt crusaders and the vile kings of France. It hasn't been long since those times - now that we are free, we should regain our affluence!"
 TOU_idea_4: "Consistori del Gay Saber"
 TOU_idea_4_desc: "Consistory of the Gay Science isn't about finding new ways for spoiled young nobles to sodomize themselves - its something created to preserve fine chants and songs of troubadours for future Occitan generations. We should promote poetry for contenting young nobles in more moral way, preserving the lenga d'Oc and keeping our country stable."
 TOU_idea_5: "Capitouls"
 TOU_idea_5_desc: "The city of Toulouse began to free itself from feudal laws early, and in 1152 'Capitouls' was founded, an assembly of city administrators that rivaled the count and fought for burghers' rights. Giving our cities privileges might be useful, when it bears us larger control over trade..."
 TOU_idea_6: "The Perfecti"
 TOU_idea_6_desc: "Seeing the incoming wave of Enlightenment sprawling across Europe, we might expect that from villages hidden deep in Languedoc hills Cathar preachers will come: the Perfecti, living ascetic lifestyles and teaching people about who really created the world and who is really worshipped by Catholic priests. We should take advantage and either use them as priests of New Christianity or learn their methods and hunt down the Good Men once and for all."
 TOU_idea_7: "Remember the Montsegur"
 TOU_idea_7_desc: "None can say Good Men were sinners, without being a sinner himself. None can say Cathars were vile and malicious, without being vile and malicious himself. None can say crusaders saved the souls of people they burned at stakes, without having his soul bound eternally to the Satanic construct of Earth. Yet they said those lies, and repeat them while walking upon ashes of murdered people, and we may justly tell our troops, marching on to fight enemies of Toulouse, paraphrasing words of Arnaud Amaury, butcher of Beziers: kill them all, Satan will sort out his own."
#Champagne
 CHP_ideas: "Champagnian Ideas"
 CHP_ideas_start: "Champagnian Traditions"
 CHP_ideas_bonus: "Champagnian Ambition"
 CHP_idea_1: "Royal Seneschals"
 CHP_idea_1_desc: "All courtiers in the French royal court had to obey a seneschal: he also administered royal domains and replaced the King in many matters when he was absent. Such great power in the Kingdom of France was hereditary to counts of Champagne: now one of the contestants for the throne in Paris. Our past gives us great knowledge in civil matters and administration."
 CHP_idea_2: "Champagnian Independence"
 CHP_idea_2_desc: "It is imperative for us to know that we were nearly an independent county; we definitely have the most experience in how to be sovereign rulers, and it shows."
 CHP_idea_3: "Champagne Fairs"
 CHP_idea_3_desc: "In latter days Champagnian fairs were a main contributor to abundance and prosperity in Champagne. Incorporation of Champagne into France made them lose their importance. We are independent, for now, and should strive to make cities like Provins and Brie full of Italian merchants again."
 CHP_idea_4: "Battle of Chalons"
 CHP_idea_4_desc: "It is on our ground where Hunnic hordes were stopped and crushed by Aetius, the Last Roman. We are proud to host such sacred ground, and we are bound to learn from Romans about their tactics and strategy, which saved Europe from utter destruction."
 CHP_idea_5: "Cathedral of Reims"
 CHP_idea_5_desc: "In the cathedral in our capital the Kings of France had to be crowned, and that gives us a great advantage in uniting the shattered country - we already have the required place of coronation. While our architects and engineers work on strengthening its defence, we should learn how to strengthen the ties between duchies that will bow to us when we unite France."
 CHP_idea_6: "Thibaut the Troubadour's Chants"
 CHP_idea_6_desc: "One of the counts of Champagne and King of Navarre as well, Thibaut de Blois, was a famous crusader and poet. The Renaissance wave that arrived in our lands from Italy might cause a revolution in our arts and poetry, but his call to holy war will never be drowned out:\n'Qui n'a en soi pitié ni souvenance,\nAu haut Seigneur doit chercher sa vengeance,\nEt délivrer sa terre et son pays.'"
 CHP_idea_7: "Champagne"
 CHP_idea_7_desc: "Our wines were always highly prized, but one monk known as Dom Perignon was said to have invented a wine that became famous not only as the drink of royalty and great people, but also as 'the wine of civilization'; a beverage that is somewhat like a landmark of the West and its whole cultural heritage. Considering its taste... words can't describe it. Poetry merely offers a weak facsimile. One can only drink it to know what Champagne is, and through its bubbles new ideas flow into the minds of great politicians and kings. Cork pops will sign great Champagnian military victories and successes of science and diplomacy."
#Avignon
 AVI_ideas: "Avignonais Ideas"
 AVI_ideas_start: "Avignonais Traditions"
 AVI_ideas_bonus: "Avignonais Ambition"
 AVI_idea_1: "Sieges of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_1_desc: "The city of Avignon was sieged multiple times - first in antiquity, then the Dark Ages and the medieval period - as we are no mere village, but an important metropolis! We have learned what it means to be prepared for diseases, lack of food and water, and we will be always prepared to survive even years of siege. God helps those who help themselves..."
 AVI_idea_2: "Avignon Exchange"
 AVI_idea_2_desc: "We are prodigies in the modern-day economy: the new invention of foreign exchange markets was first established here in 1248. The Holy See used it to maintain numerable financial relations with European monarchs, but now we are free. If we restrict its use to our economic adversaries, we will quickly see their economy falter."
 AVI_idea_3: "Republic of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_3_desc: "Because of our economic importance, we once declared ourselves a republic. Short was her life: feudal lords quickly subdued us to their rule. But we never forget that small communes should have a degree of autonomy, for it makes them more willing to assimilate."
 AVI_idea_4: "University of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_4_desc: "Rejoice! A wild horde of drunkards, rascals, and easygoers can come to our city and study there! Nothing good will come of this, as every coin they pay us goes toward rebuilding what they have destroyed in their drunken rage. However, ages of dealing with students gave us experience at dealing with most unpleasant diplomats politely."
 AVI_idea_5: "Palais des Papes"
 AVI_idea_5_desc: "Let's face it: Avignon popes were not really rightful popes. Not truly independent, they marked the beginning of a schism tormenting the one true Catholic Church. The Palace of Popes (and Antipopes) is a reminder of how they used to claim things that were not quite theirs. Who said it is not useful in politics?"
 AVI_idea_6: "Bridge of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_6_desc: "Legend has it the bridge in Avignon was built by Saint Benezet. When Jesus himself told him to create a passage across the Rhone, he formed The Bridge Brotherhood to help him in construction. Recreation of this Brotherhood will enhance communication a lot."
 AVI_idea_7: "Great Schism"
 AVI_idea_7_desc: "We must remember the times when we were the seat of the spiritual ruler of half of Europe: the Pope of Avignon was supported by the kings of France, Scotland, Aragon and Castile. The time of glory will come once more, however, not by the power of the Church, but by the power of our armies and subjects."

 die_idea_2: "Nibelungenlied"
 die_idea_2_desc: "This epic poem claims our city derives its name from the Burgundian hero Siegfried, who slew a dragon - or 'Wurm' - nearby. Though this etymology is apocryphal, we do have a tradition of producing talented warriors."
 die_idea_3: "Carolingian Traditions"
 die_idea_3_desc: "Worms was an important site in the old Frankish Empire, and was even chosen by Charlemagne as the site for an administrative palace. The pan-European tradition of the Franks lives on in our citizens."
 die_idea_4: "Embrace Jewish Community"
 die_idea_4_desc: "For centuries, Worms has been the site of a thriving Ashkenazic Jewish community. Though the city's history is fraught with conflict and pogroms, fostering cooperation between our religions will help the city mature as a whole."
 die_idea_5: "Privileges of Emperor Heinrich"
 die_idea_5_desc: "Heinrich III Salian granted Worms considerable privileges, eventually leading to our status as a Free City. It is time we reminded the Empire of this ancient tradition of Wormser supremacy."
 die_idea_6: "Imperial Diets"
 die_idea_6_desc: "Worms has been chosen as the site of several Imperial diets and concordats, most notably the 1521 Diet of Worms which declared Martin Luther a heretic. We are thus on the forefront of political issues."
 die_idea_7: "Strengthen the City Walls"
 die_idea_7_desc: "In order for such a city as Worms to survive against powerful neighboring states, we need to keep an alert garrison and sufficient defenses at the ready. Upgrading our city walls will go a long way in establishing our sovereignty, and we'll make Speyer pay for it!"

 FIU_idea_3: "Adriatic Trade Network"
 FIU_idea_3_desc: "By creating a web of contacts and trade bases, we can hold a much more important position in Adriatic trade, competing with other merchant republics such as Venice and Ragusa."
 FIU_idea_4: "Resist the Ottomans"
 FIU_idea_4_desc: "Many times the Turks have tried to occupy our city, yet they never succeeded. If we want to preserve our city from the Turk, it is imperative that we improve our walls and fortifications."
 FIU_idea_5: "Renaissance and Baroque"
 FIU_idea_5_desc: "From the XVI century onwards, our city was largely rebuilt in the new styles coming from Italy and Europe. If we invest in creating splendid palaces and gardens, our city will be the envy of all the Adriatic."
 FIU_idea_6: "Corpus Separatum"
 FIU_idea_6_desc: "We are surrounded by large and powerful nations; if we want to preserve our freedom and independence, we must carefully handle diplomacy with the neighboring monarchies to gain their protection."
 FIU_idea_7: "Indeficienter"
 FIU_idea_7_desc: "Starting from the early XIX century, the city of Fiume underwent tremendous architectural development, modernizing the city's infrastructure and turning it into the Mediterranean's fifth most important port. This age of blossoming optimism and economic welfare is reflected in the city's motto: Indeficienter (Without End)."

 PFU2_ideas_bonus: "Pfullendorfer Ambition"
 PFU2_idea_1: "The Udalrichingers"
 PFU2_idea_1_desc: "The Udalrichingers were the only dynasty to rule Pfullendorf, and exerted considerable control over the entire region north of the Bodensee."
 PFU2_idea_2: "Bodensee Trade Troubles"
 PFU2_idea_2_desc: "Pfullendorf in the 8th-10th centuries used to have a grand treasury; the recent recessions were covered up by our rulers by blaming surrounding trade cities for stealing all the trade and wealth out of our pocket, making our people believe that we really need to go and take, ahem, get back what belongs to us."
 PFU2_idea_3: "Tracked Envoys"
 PFU2_idea_3_desc: "Envoys, who are paid well by our state, have been taking too many questionable stops at bath houses and other locations on the way, so we started to accompany them with a guard, which is paid more the faster the envoy gets to the location. Results are visible from day 1."
 PFU2_idea_4: "State Rushing Construction"
 PFU2_idea_4_desc: "Pfullendorf always wants to impress the local population of the city with new monuments and constructions, and the rulers are trying to get their moment of glory as early as possible, forcing the construction workers to speed up."
 PFU2_idea_5: "The Careful Approach to Politics"
 PFU2_idea_5_desc: "Ever since Count Ludwig was assassinated we have distanced ourselves from politics for the security of our own rulers; we shall not repeat our mistakes."
 PFU2_idea_6: "Center of Fake News"
 PFU2_idea_6_desc: "Whenever some nearby state decides to start drama about us, we have our own printers ready; we pay them a coin or two for manipulating the news in favour of our side."
 PFU2_idea_7: "A Free Refuge for Rebel Commanders"
 PFU2_idea_7_desc: "Rebels are being persecuted in surrounding lands, but Pfullendorf, with the complex laws that it has, cannot persecute them. Rebel group leaders know this and have used Pfullendorf as their base of operations, and it just so happens that Pfullendorf itself might have some interests in cutting the power of some states."
#Frei Pfullendorf
 PFU_ideas: "Frei Pfullendorfer Ideas"
 PFU_ideas_start: "Frei Pfullendorfer Traditions"
 PFU_ideas_bonus: "Frei Pfullendorfer Ambition"
 PFU_idea_1: "Pfullendorfer Construction Quality"
 PFU_idea_1_desc: "Pfullendorf builders are some of the best in Europe; their houses stand for over 700 years until they get destroyed by war, a sad truth of Europa."
 PFU_idea_2: "Aggression of Konstanz Bishops"
 PFU_idea_2_desc: "In June 1220, Emperor Frederick II elevated Pfullendorf to the status of Imperial City. However, the prince-bishops of Constance, as the biggest landowners in the Linzgau and patrons of several religious institutions such as Holy Spirit Hospital in Pfullendorf, continued to exert significant political influence over the whole area. At the Council of Constance (1415), King Sigismund granted Blutgerichtsbarkeit to the town, a status that confirmed the city as being answerable to God and to the Emperor only."
 PFU_idea_3: "Member of Swabian League"
 PFU_idea_3_desc: "Pfullendorf became a member of the powerful Swabian League in 1488 and took part in the war of 1492 against Duke Albrecht of Bavaria. The city was assigned to contribute 4 footmen, 6 horsemen, 4 wagons and 8 tents for the campaign."
 PFU_idea_4: "Catholic Free City"
 PFU_idea_4_desc: "Like a few other small Free Imperial Cities in the vicinity of Lake Constance, Pfullendorf was comparatively untouched by the turmoil that engulfed Germany during the Protestant Reformation and it was to be one of the 12 Free Imperial Cities, out of 50, that was to be officially classified as Catholic at the Peace of Westphalia, that also explicitly stated for the first time that Free Imperial Cities enjoyed the same degree of independence (Imperial immediacy) as the other Imperial Estates."
 PFU_idea_5: "City of Peace"
 PFU_idea_5_desc: "Although the Black Death, the Peasants' War, the Reformation, the Thirty Years' War, the War of the Spanish Succession and the French Revolution left their marks on the region, Pfullendorf was able to avoid major destruction."
 PFU_idea_6: "A Good Example for Others"
 PFU_idea_6_desc: "Starting in 1383, Pfullendorf ruled itself according to a constitution that gave decisive powers to the town guilds and provided for the annual election of the mayor. A 50-member 'High Council' also elected annually, was vested with executive authority alongside a 17-member 'Small Council' chaired by the mayor. With brief interruptions, this guild-based constitution remained in force until 1803 and was to serve as a model for other cities."
 PFU_idea_7: "Renowned in History Books"
 PFU_idea_7_desc: "Like most of the other 50 Free Imperial Cities, Pfullendorf lost its freedom in the course of the mediatization of 1803 and was annexed to the Margraviate of Baden."

 JCH_idea_5: "Tomato, Tomahto"
 JCH_idea_5_desc: "With Julich and Berg following Catholicism, and Cleves being Protestant, tolerance is a must to keep the duchy strong and united."
 JCH_idea_6: "Tulips and Schnitzel"
 JCH_idea_6_desc: "Occupying lands with Dutch and German peoples, Julich must embrace both windmills and whatever Germans like."

 LBO_idea_1: "Blue is the Warmest Color"
 LBO_idea_1_desc: "Lesbos is the last great island before the Hellespont, and as such we command great power in the lucrative Black Sea trade. Our turquoise and sapphire waters house innumerable ships, and ensure our naval supremacy in the face of domineering foes."
 LBO_idea_2: "Sappho's Legacy"
 LBO_idea_2_desc: "Though most of her poetry is lost to time, Sappho is by far the most prolific native of Lesbos. Her writings on love and her libertine lifestyle survive in popular history and myth to the present day, inspiring the population to greatness."
 LBO_idea_3: "Life is Strange"
 LBO_idea_3_desc: "Separated from their Italian origins by hundreds of leagues of open sea, the ruling caste of Lesbos has blended with the native population, becoming enchanted by the island's arcadian bays. Let us export this tolerance to use in our statecraft."
 LBO_idea_4: "Mulholland Drive"
 LBO_idea_4_desc: "From the Soomras of India to the Ó Maolchalanns of Northern Ireland, our nation has a drive to bring all the known world under our benevolent fold. Let no man, woman, or child think of themselves first as a clan and second as a citizen, for all are Lesbians at heart!"
 LBO_idea_5: "Legend of Flora"
 LBO_idea_5_desc: "Lesbos is one of the sunniest islands in the Aegean, and home to much strange flora and fauna. The island's petrified forest has taken a legendary status among our neighbors, and many adventurers travel from far and wide to witness it in person."
 LBO_idea_6: "Gone Home"
 LBO_idea_6_desc: "The northern Greek islands were first granted to the Gattilusi by Genoa, following Latin Europe's inroads after the Fourth Crusade. Though they have indeed mixed with the locals, it would be wise to foster diplomatic ties to distant relatives on the mainland, securing military assistance and trade deals."
 LBO_idea_7: "Superintendents"
 LBO_idea_7_desc: "Whether in the tiny suburbs of Mytilene or the palatial halls of Terok Nor, superintendents are necessary to keep civil order and ensure productivity. By drawing from the populations of our diverse surroundings - Asia Minor, the Balkans, the Latin redoubts - we can maintain a top-tier task force who would surely never betray us to the first Trill they lay eyes on."

 LSN_idea_2_desc: "The Lavaux Vineyard Terraces, stretching for about 30 km along the south-facing northern shores of Lake Geneva from the Chateau de Chillon to the eastern outskirts of Lausanne in the Vaud region, cover the lower slopes of the mountainside between the villages and the lake. They are now a renowned vineyard throughout Europe, bringing us esteem in other courts."

 PTR_idea_5: "Chalamala"
 PTR_idea_5_desc: "A weird bard has appeared in our courts, he calls himself Chalamala and wears the most grotesque clothes. He sings these warlike exploits in vibrant poems, which he gladly intermingles, of these fabliaux, the lays of love, and other light pieces so much in honor at the time of the trouvères. It seems that the foreign courts like him very much, and now are more inclined to open relations with us."
 PTR_idea_6: "The Goats of Satan"
 PTR_idea_6_desc: "Seeing the enemies invading our territory, the women of Gruyère had gathered all the goats inside the town to feed themselves during the siege. The evening had fallen and the battle was not over. One woman had an idea to put torches on the horns of the goats and then drive them towards the invaders. When they saw them arrive, the intruders fled, wondering whether an army of the devil was coming to our aid. So the goats are now celebrated just like the two heroes."

We shall remember their sacrifice and carry on their spirit to protect our homeland!"
 XSM_idea_2: "Abbey of Saint-Maurice"

 VLL_idea_1_desc: "In 999, King Rodolphe III entrusted the rights to the bishop of Sion and his successors. This document, the charter of donation of 999, established at Cudrefin, on the shore of Lake Neuchâtel, is the authentic founding act of the Valais as a state.

 CMO_idea_6: "Between Lake and Valleys"
 CMO_idea_6_desc: "Lake Como, or Lario as it is called by the locals, is a fundamental part of the Comaschian economy and trade, and its control lets us have a better grip on the many villages lying along its shores. Also, our control of important valleys in the Alps like Valtellina, Val d'Intelvi, Valchiavenna and the lower part of Ticino gives us the opportunity to control the trade that goes through the Central Alps."
 CMO_idea_7: "Rusconi and Vitani"

The most important Ghibelline family in Como were the Rusca, or Rusconi, who owned large estates in Ticino, supported the Milanese family of Visconti and managed to create a Signoria twice in Como, while the Guelph family of Vitany opposed them. The many battles between the two factions have created battle-hardened men that we can recruit."

The initial cultivation of wine and the first castle can be traced back to this period. It ended however, as the legend goes, because of the murdering of the Graf's infant daughter, Regiswindis.

 SMX_idea_1_desc: "Hailing from the Illyrian island of Rab, Saint Marinus came to Italy around the turn of the fourth century to escape Emperor Diocletian's persecution. He eventually founded a monastery on the future site of San Marino in 301 AD, and upon his death he allegedly stated 'Relinquo vos liberos ab utroque homine' - freeing the city from both Pope and Emperor - but it wasn't until the kindly noble Felicissima that the citizens were truly independent."
 SMX_idea_2: "The Oldest Republic"
 SMX_idea_2_desc: "Since the ancient Greeks, republics have dotted Europe. Even great Rome was once a republic, freed from the tyranny of Tarquinius Superbus, until the treachery of Julius Caesar led it once again towards autocracy. But while these republics fell, San Marino has stood testament to Republican ideals for centuries on end. May it last to the end of time!"
 SMX_idea_3: "Establish Captains Regent"
 SMX_idea_3_desc: "In 1243 the Sammarinese republic moved from its old system, the 'Arengo' - a council of family leaders similar to the Roman senate - to a dual position of Capitani Reggenti, more like Roman consuls. Their terms only lasted for six months, and each was nominated from an opposing party, ensuring a balanced government free from the ambitions of those who wished to establish hereditary rule."
 SMX_idea_4: "Mountain Commune"
 SMX_idea_4_desc: "The nucleus of San Marino is centered upon Monte Titano, making it easily defensible. It was only until the deposition of Sigismondo Pandolfo in the 1400s that the republic expanded to include other cities, though a tradition of civil disobedience remained in the population. When Cardinal Giulio Alberoni occupied the republic and forced a new constitution upon it, the citizens refused to bow to his demands and soon won back their freedom."
 SMX_idea_5: "Statutes of 1600"
 SMX_idea_5_desc: "The Statutes of 1600 were the first documents pertaining to the administration of the Republic. Soon after, the Republic signed a treaty with the Papal States guaranteeing its protection and independence. Though strained by later developments, this treaty lasted to nearly the end of the Papal States' existence as a political entity."
 SMX_idea_6: "Napoleonic Friendship"
 SMX_idea_6_desc: "Napoléon's conquest of Italy put San Marino in a precarious situation, needing to balance its allegiance to the Papal States with the threat of French aggression. Surprisingly, San Marino inspired a personal fondness in Napoléon himself, who recognized the state's freedom, exempted it from taxation, wrote in praise to his commissars, and even offered to annex more territory to it. Though the Sammarinese declined this offer, they maintained a shared dedication to Republicanism."
 SMX_idea_7: "The Last Microstate"
 SMX_idea_7_desc: "During Giuseppe Garibaldi's wars to unify Italy into a single Kingdom, San Marino gave refuge to many persecuted Unificationists, including Garibaldi himself. In return, Garibaldi exempted San Marino from the new Italian state when he eventually won out over the other peninsular powers. Thus San Marino was left as the only Italian microstate left in existence, surrounded completely by the Kingdom. The Principality of Monaco remained independent as well, but had been as much in the orbit of France as Italy historically."

 XME_idea_1: "Duchy of the Sea"
 XME_idea_1_desc: "The Slovenian name for Merania was 'Vojvodina Meranija', coming from the native word for 'sea' - 'morje'. Though its lands were later centered around inland Bavaria and Franconia, it started out on the Adriatic roughly corresponding to the territory of the former Istrian March and Carniola. Some chroniclers even assigned it the whole Dalmatian littoral, though this claim is dubious as the Kingdom of Croatia firmly held these lands until Venetian incursions."
 XME_idea_2: "Reichsunmittelbarkeit"
 XME_idea_2_desc: "Imperial Immediacy held a ruler of the Holy Roman Empire to be a complete sovereign in his own lands, answerable only to the Emperor himself. The status was closely linked to the title Imperial Prince, and while both eventually became quite common throughout the empire, Merania was one of the earlier polities to enjoy these prestigious accolades. The Dukes were thus considered part of the highest noble ranks."
 XME_idea_3: "Serbian Connections"
 XME_idea_3_desc: "Friedrich Barbarossa's abortive Crusade was launched by land through the Balkans, starting by traveling through Merania. He negotiated a marriage between the Meranian duke's daughter and Prince Toljen of Hum, a relative of the rulers of Serbia. It is unknown whether the planned marriage took place, but regardless, Merania maintained a geographical and political connection with the Serbs."
 XME_idea_4: "Expand into Croatia"
 XME_idea_4_desc: "Much of Merania's titular territory was purely theoretical, lying under the de facto control of Croatia and Hungary. The Dukes did not hesitate, however, to expand at the expense of these Slavic states, conquering such cities as Gottschee and Tschernembl, and thus establishing a border that would last for nearly a thousand years and counting. Though eventually ending up under Slovene sovereignty, these freshly conquered cities became integral outposts in the Germanic empire's frontier."
 XME_idea_5: "Meranian Fever"
 XME_idea_5_desc: "The control of ports on a busy inland sea exposes one to numerous plagues and diseases. Learning from Italian neighbors, the Meranian subjects demonstrate an adeptness at naval management and warfare. From quarantines to cannon fire, a master can be found in any Meranian port."
 XME_idea_6: "The House of Andechs"
 XME_idea_6_desc: "The decadent house of Andechs, originating in Southwestern Bavaria, was invested with the Duchy of Merania towards the end of the twelfth century to balance power versus the Wittelsbachs. Though separated by vast gaps, the Andechser dukes held the original Adriatic lands, their homelands, massive Franconian holdings, the rich Tyrolean city of Innsbruck, and even the Palatinate of Burgundy on the opposite side of the Empire."
 XME_idea_7: "Episcopal Loyalty"
 XME_idea_7_desc: "When Pope and Emperor took arms against each other for the second time since the Investiture Controversy, under the rule of the Hohenstaufens, the Dukes of Merania decided to stay loyal to their nominal overlord, the Bishop of Bamberg. Though this earned Duke Otto an Imperial Ban and the confiscation of all territories, none could say Merania was disloyal to the true faith."

The use of Peat in the brewing process gives the whiskey a smoky quality, attracting connoisseurs from across the world."

 AYL_idea_1: "Somerled"
 AYL_idea_1_desc: "Somhairle - the greatest of all the Norse-Gaels. Before his glorious conquest of Innse Gall from the Viking scourge, Somerled ruled as lord of Argyll. His prowess and versatility live on in the land."
 AYL_idea_2: "Unite the Lordships"
 AYL_idea_2_desc: "The core lands of Argyll were originally divided between the lordships of Argyll Proper and of Lorne. In 1222, however, in recognition for royal assistance, Somerled's grandson Donnchad was invested with both titles, essentially uniting them."
 AYL_idea_3: "Dál Riata Heritage"
 AYL_idea_3_desc: "Argyll emerged as a political entity after the old Irish thalassocratic kingdom of Dál Riata was thrown into chaos, its mainland possessions being cleft from its islands. The Alban kingdom and numerous prominent dynasties claim descent from this ancient state, but our claim is one of the most legitimate."
 AYL_idea_4: "Diocese of Argyll"
 AYL_idea_4_desc: "Since the middle ages, Argyll was home to its own titular bishopric, seated at Saint Moluag's Cathedral in Lismore. Moluag is the patron saint of Argyll, adding on to the region's religious prestige."
 AYL_idea_5: "Kintyre"
 AYL_idea_5_desc: "Though it changed hands many times, the Kintyre peninsula is a jewel in the diadem of Argyll. From its famous Mull to its colorful history - such as the time a Norse king dragged his ships across it - Kintyre contributes to all facets of Argyllian strength and notability."
 AYL_idea_6: "Renovate Inveraray Castle"
 AYL_idea_6_desc: "The ruins of an older fortification were improved in 1743, establishing the basis of Inveraray Castle. Its Gothic architecture has stood as a foreboding reminder of Ducal power ever since - especially after the village was moved away from the castle just to give the occupants more space."
 AYL_idea_7: "Patrick MacKellar"
 AYL_idea_7_desc: "A native Argyllian, Patrick MacKellar was a prominent army officer involved in engineering the sieges, razing, and reconstruction of several cities across multiple continents. May his expertise be reflected in his homeland!"

 FFE_idea_1: "Coronation Rights"
 FFE_idea_1_desc: "The Earls of Fife were one of the most ancient and noble houses, and as such they were afforded the greatest honor in medieval Scotland - the coronation of the Scottish kings."
 FFE_idea_2: "Beware Macduff"
 FFE_idea_2_desc: "The descendants of Dubh, Mormaer of Fife, were known as Clan Macduff. One particular Mormaer is famous for joining the rebellion against King Macbeth of Alba, immortalized in Shakespeare's eponymous play. In the play, Macduff eventually kills Macbeth, fulfilling the warning - 'Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff; Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.'"
 FFE_idea_3: "Assume the Title Justiciar"
 FFE_idea_3_desc: "Many Fifian Earls simultaneously held the honorific title 'Justiciar of Scotia', the highest legal office within the kingdom. Responsibilities included supervising the realm's sheriffs and sergeants, holding court, and meeting with the King - while the privileges were innumerable."
 FFE_idea_4: "Capitalis Legis Clenmcduffe"
 FFE_idea_4_desc: "Our title is fundamentally linked to our dynasty, and in many cases the chief of Clan Duff led the men of Fife rather than the invested Mormaer. Our legitimacy will remain unquestioned."
 FFE_idea_5: "Battle of Falkirk"
 FFE_idea_5_desc: "Although the battle of Falkirk was a loss, the men of Fife were present defending Scotland from English machinations, and showed their courage on the battlefield. This Fifian bravery will go down in history."
 FFE_idea_6: "Princess Isabella"
 FFE_idea_6_desc: "Princess Isabella became the suo-jure countess of Fife upon the death of her father, and went through several high-profile marriages - all her spouses quickly dying. Let us learn from her Machiavellian diplomacy."
 FFE_idea_7: "Or a Lion Rampart Gules"
 FFE_idea_7_desc: "The only difference between the Coat of Arms of Scotland proper and of Fife is the royal addition of a flowery border. Some even theorize the royal arms are derived from Fife. Either way, the Fifian arms are a testament to its nobility."

 catducal_idea_1: "Marca Hispanica"
 catducal_idea_1_desc: "The Spanish March was the first Carolingian bulwark against the Umayyad Caliphate. After drifting out of the French sphere of influence, several counties emerged from it - among them, ours. The tradition of frontier defense lives on in the Catalans, who will fight fiercely against heathen neighbors."
 catducal_idea_2: "Diocese of Urgell"
 catducal_idea_2_desc: "Urgell holds its own ecclesiastical diocese, one of the most ancient in Iberia. The state of Andorra was co-ruled by the Bishops of Urgell, and many members of the comital House of Urgell held the position over the centuries. In this way, the Catalan dynasties held power even beyond their political borders."
 catducal_idea_3: "Cerdanya Laws"
 catducal_idea_3_desc: "The county of Cerdanya descended from Wilfred the Hairy and the Bellonids. Even up to the second millennium, Cerdanya maintained the legal traditions of the Carolingian Franks - Salic Law - and that of the Visigoths who preceded them. A sophisticated judicial system consisted of both Judices and Boni Homines, who presided over trials."
 catducal_idea_4: "Fortifying the Counties"
 catducal_idea_4_desc: "Enemies surround us on all sides, from the Moors lodged around the Western Mediterranean to the French dukes across the Pyrenees and even other ambitious Spanish states who would like to expand their influence over our lands. We should improve our defenses and use the mountains to our advantage."
 catducal_idea_5: "Reunite the Pallars"
 catducal_idea_5_desc: "The County of Pallars was nestled in the valleys of the Pyrenees, ensuring its survival. In 1011, upon the death of Suñer I, the county was divided between his sons into two new states, Pallars Jussà and Pallars Sobirà. With its two administrative centers reunited, local defense and tax collection would be easier."
 catducal_idea_6: "Catalan Independence"
 catducal_idea_6_desc: "With the accession of Hugh Capet in 987, the Catalan counties refused to pay homage to the new dynasty, fostering more of a connection with their fellow Iberian states in the form of Navarra and Aragon. Over the ensuing centuries, despite the expansion of the counts of Barcelona and the Aragonese kings, many smaller Catalan counties retained their independence. Even after they were absorbed, the Catalans sought free rule and special privileges."
 catducal_idea_7: "Pirineus Ironworking"
 catducal_idea_7_desc: "We are the pioneers of mountainside ironworking, trying out new methods and seeking ever greater efficiency. With proper ore smelting, the Catalan counties can support a well-equipped military to hold off our enemies. Diverting state funds to the effort is the best way to ensure our success."

 SKN_ideas_bonus: "Skanian Ambition"
 SKN_idea_1: "Øresund Ports"
 SKN_idea_1_desc: "The 'Ear-Sound' is first attested in Norse writing at the turn of the second millennium. The narrow waterway commands trade between the whole Baltic Sea and the rest of the world, making its control invaluable. Skania is centered upon some of its most important ports, such as Lund and Malmø. We should use this to our advantage."
 SKN_idea_2: "Harald Bluetooth's Conquests"
 SKN_idea_2_desc: "Originally, Skania was made up of five tribal units or Thanedoms, consisting of disorganized farmers. The first Danish king Haraldr united the region in the tenth century, overseeing its Christianization. Haraldr was the greatest of Scandinavian rulers, and a great asset to the true faith. Now that we have regained our independence, we Skanians should model our society after his vision!"
 SKN_idea_3: "Skanian Law"
 SKN_idea_3_desc: "Encoded at the turn of the thirteenth century, Skanian Law is the oldest provincial law code in Denmark. Within the vernacular manuscript were laws regarding property, farming, fishing, criminal justice, marriage, heritage, common land, and more. We can further cement these laws by producing a Runic edition, a 'Codex Runicus', in this most ancient language of our fathers."
 SKN_idea_4: "Found the Lund Academy"
 SKN_idea_4_desc: "In 1425 a Franciscan monastery in Lund opened a university, dubbed 'the Academy'. Though it was eventually shut down in the wake of the reformation, it contributed greatly to the scholasticism of the region. In 1666, a spiritual successor was established in the form of the Regia Academia Caroline, which continued to educate Skania's citizens."
 SKN_idea_5: "Dominium Maris Baltici"
 SKN_idea_5_desc: "Establishing a Baltic Sea Dominion over the sea's entire coastline is the goal of all Scandinavian rulers. Due to its crucial position on the borderland between Denmark and Sweden, Skania has seen many battles on land and sea, and was endlessly fought over by foreign powers. Now that we have learned from these various attempted invasions, we can realize our own aspirations of dominance."
 SKN_idea_6: "Loyal Protestants"
 SKN_idea_6_desc: "Like most of Scandinavia, Skania abandoned the Church of Rome and decided to instead follow the teachings of Martin Luther. While continental Europe was rocked by endless pogroms and revolts, Skania was quite unified in its religious views."
 SKN_idea_7: "Resist Swedification"
 SKN_idea_7_desc: "The Swedes have desperately tried to stamp out Skanian culture, depriving us of our history and our dialect. We must resist their imperialistic advances and ensure our culture survives."

 SZK_idea_1_desc: "Unio Trium Nationum was an alliance established in 1438 by the three Transylvanian Estates. The Hungarian nobility, the Saxon merchants, and the free military Szeklers. The union was a pact directed against the peasantry, many of whom were Romanian. This alliance would have a long lasting and unexpected impact on the history of our people."
 SZK_idea_2: "Guardians of the East"
 SZK_idea_2_desc: "The position of our lands on the easternmost border of the Carpathian mountains and across the Burzenland means the Székelys have been Hungary's frontier against the aggression of hordes and heathens. It was through these passes that the Mongols advanced in 1241, and we must ensure this never happens again."
 SZK_idea_3: "Comes Siculorum"
 SZK_idea_3_desc: "In the twelfth century the Szeklers of Transylvania were organized into a county, with its leaders appointed by the Hungarian king. This arrangement greatly benefited our people by turning us into an organized political entity, and the Kings of Hungary eventually adopted 'Count of the Szeklers' among their own titles."
 SZK_idea_4: "Cultural Melting Pot"
 SZK_idea_4_desc: "The origin of the Székely people has been long debated, but the commonly accepted explanation is that our ancestors were Magyars who mixed with Avars, Khazars, and Bolghars. Deftly handling multiple ethnicities and practices is part of our nation's ethos."
 SZK_idea_5: "Sun and Moon"
 SZK_idea_5_desc: "The icons of the Sun and Moon have been important to Magyars since the original conquest of the Carpathian basin. After the Christianization of the Kingdom, these symbols lost some of their significance, except for in Székelyland, where they are still in use."
 SZK_idea_6: "The Székely Seats"
 SZK_idea_6_desc: "Unlike feudal counties, Seats were unique administrative divisions in the kingdom of Hungary with extra autonomy and guaranteed rights. In return, military service was demanded. Thus the Seats are a boon to both our administrative efficiency and our fighting prowess."
 SZK_idea_7: "Beacon of Light"
 SZK_idea_7_desc: "Surrounded by Orthodox Christians and eventually Calvinists, the Székelys remained loyal to the Catholic Church. We are a city upon a hill, a beacon of light in the valley of the shadow of death."

The union was a pact directed against the peasantry, many of whom were Romanian. This alliance would have a long lasting and unexpected impact on the history of our people."
 KLY_idea_2: "Guardians of the South"
 KLY_idea_2_desc: "Under the guidance of King Géza II the so-called 'Saxons' colonized southern Transylvania, closing off the passes used by Pechenegs and other hordes to raid the Carpathian basin. In tandem with the Teutonic Order in the Burzenland, we thus have a history of defending our homeland from foreign aggression."
 KLY_idea_3: "Diploma Andreanum"
 KLY_idea_3_desc: "The 1224 Golden Charter of the Transylvanian Saxons codified our rights and the land we would control as an autonomous entity. It was from this Royal document that we earned the name 'Royal Lands', or 'Királyföld' in Hungarian. We should reaffirm these rights given to us by András II, and seek a confirmation from the current Hungarian monarch that they will never be infringed."
 KLY_idea_4: "Restore the Kirchenburgen"
 KLY_idea_4_desc: "After the Mongols devastated our lands in the thirteenth century, our towns invested in fortified churches with massive walls. Many have fallen into disrepair over the centuries as we grew decadent under the demise of the Hordes' power. It would be foolish, however, to let a great pre-existing defensive infrastructure go to waste, when there are still enemies stirring on all sides."
 KLY_idea_5: "Igrisch and Kerz"
 KLY_idea_5_desc: "We have shared a national religious identity since the earliest days of our colonization efforts, through such institutions as the 1191 Provostship of Hermannstadt. In later years, it was the Cistercian abbeys at Igrisch and Kerz which kept us united, and finally the wisdom of Johannes Honter, a Lutheran reformer who led the population in a mass conversion."
 KLY_idea_6: "The Saxon Seats"
 KLY_idea_6_desc: "Transylvanian Saxons were divided into Seats (special administrative divisions exempt from the usual comital feudal system by the King) with seven major towns - Schässburg, Mühlbach, Hermannstädt, Mediasch, Kronstadt, Klausenburg, and Bistritz. It was from these seven towns that we derived our name in many languages, such as German 'Siebenbürgen'. Administering our lands is thus quite easy compared to some states."
 KLY_idea_7: "Stephan Ludwig Roth"
 KLY_idea_7_desc: "Under a backdrop of revolutions and nationalism, Stephan Ludwig Roth allied with other factions of Transylvania in support of a union with the Romanian states. As a pastor and an intellectual, Roth was respected by his Saxon countrymen, but was ultimately assassinated by treacherous Hungarian radicals. We will not let his memory die - HIS NAME WAS STEPHAN ROTH!"

 wendish_idea_1_desc: "The Germans pushed the boundary of the Holy Roman Empire beyond the Elbe in the tenth century, establishing the Northern March and the Billung March. This all changed, however, in AD 983, when the Lutici and the Obotriti led a unilateral uprising against their foreign occupiers. Many Christian sites were plundered, and the Empire's control beyond the Elbe collapsed completely."
 wendish_idea_2: "Danish Trade"
 wendish_idea_2_desc: "The Kingdom of Denmark is our greatest trade partner, with the Baltic Sea providing easy ship access to their southern islands. Lolland, Møn, and Falster are all littered with Wendish trading posts. Continuing this mercantile tradition is in our best interest, but some even engage in lucrative piracy."
 wendish_idea_3: "Restore Radegost"
 wendish_idea_3_desc: "It is known by various names - Rethra, Radagoszcz, Redigast... As the center of Slavic Pagan civilization, this great city and temple complex was a testament to Slavic power until the heathen crusaders destroyed it. Rebuilding must begin immediately if we are to survive as a cultural unit."
 wendish_idea_4: "The Confederations"
 wendish_idea_4_desc: "To resist foreign aggression, many Wends united together into great tribal confederations. The largest two were the Obotrites and the Liutizians, made up of such tribes as the Redarians, Tollensians, and Wagrians. This strategy of cooperation has served us well in the past, and improvements in infrastructure should allow us to take it to the next level of officiality."
 wendish_idea_5: "Wendish Crusade"
 wendish_idea_5_desc: "Our power was so threatening to the Germans that they launched a full scale Crusade against us in 1147. The greatest Kings, Dukes, and Bishops of the land needed to band together to make a dent in our defenses. Such is the bravery of our soldiers, and the resolve of our faithful!"
 wendish_idea_6: "Drvovid of the Rani"
 wendish_idea_6_desc: "The Rani, occupying the island of Rügen, were one of the most powerful Wendish tribes, and the only tribe to style their ruler as a King. Even more honored than the king, however, was the high oracle Priest, called the Drvovid. Such elevation of Church over State attests to the sophistication of Wendish government structures."
 wendish_idea_7: "Ostsiedlung"

 livonian_idea_1_desc: "The Greeks call it 'Emporike Odos Varangos-Hellenon', their main trade route with the Norse Varangians. The rivers of Livonia are a crucial part of this route, leading from the Baltic to the Kievan Rus and eventually Byzantium. We can thus exact tolls on travelers and hold an important role in Eastern geopolitics."
 livonian_idea_2: "Amber Deposits"
 livonian_idea_2_desc: "Prehistoric geological processes resulted in the Pruthenian and Livonian coasts being rich with Amber, which was at times valued even more than Gold. By expanding our collection of coastal Amber deposits, we can turn Livonia into an economic powerhouse through trade down the Amber Road."
 livonian_idea_3: "Principalities of Latgalia"
 livonian_idea_3_desc: "Among the southern Livonian tribes, the Latgalians were the most advanced, holding extensive connections with the Orthodox Rus of Polotsk. Organized Christian principalities like Koknese and Jersika emerged on Latgalian land, who could deftly negotiate with European crusaders to avoid the devastation of their territories and attain mutually beneficial deals. The Latgalians would go on to form the basis of Latvia itself as they assimilated their neighboring tribes."
 livonian_idea_4: "Vikings of Curonia"
 livonian_idea_4_desc: "The Curonians were a seafaring tribe, and were considered the most restless and wealthy of the tribes, amassing great riches through naval warfare and piracy. Many considered them Baltic Vikings, as their bravery on the sea was matched by their fierceness on land."
 livonian_idea_5: "Farmlands of Semigallia"
 livonian_idea_5_desc: "Between Latgalia and Curonia lay the twin lands of the Semigallians and Selonians, known for their verdant farms and productive farmers. Wanting to continue their way of life, they were extremely resistant to the incursions of the heathen Crusaders, leading resistance under such dukes as Viestards and Nameisis."
 livonian_idea_6: "Terra Mariana"
 livonian_idea_6_desc: "After the incursions of the German crusaders, Livonia was organized into the Terra Mariana, a confederation of Crusaders, Bishoprics, and vassal tribes. Thus, even after subjugation, the Livonians remained active in the governance of the region."
 livonian_idea_7: "Letten Vorzüglich in Liefland"
 livonian_idea_7_desc: "The Enlightenment held significant sway in later Latvia, inspiring a Latvian nationalist movement. The Baltic German author Garlieb Merkel embodied the national sentiment in his book 'Die Letten Vorzüglich in Liefland am Ende des Philosophischen Jahrhunderts: Ein Beytrag zur Völker und Menschenkunde', which explained the oppression of the Latvian serfs under foreign rule. Latvians would not tolerate the same conditions under Russian rule."

The hill was decorated with wooden structures honoring different Baltic gods - Perkunas, Aušrine, Zemyna, Austeja, Ondenis, Patrimpas, Patulas, Velnias, Leda, Saula, and Menulis. Restoring this complex will be as much a boon to our naturalists as our cultural heritage."
 ZMG_idea_2: "Palemonid Legacy"
 ZMG_idea_2_desc: "The dukes of Samogitia, starting with Borkus, founder of Jurbarkas, claim descent from the legendary Roman Palemon. According to the legend, Palemon was a relative of Nero who escaped Rome with 500 families and traveled north to the Neman. The story is a myth, and was retroactively fixed to move Palemon's death into the 900s, but we don't need to let our neighbors know that."
 ZMG_idea_3: "Medininkai"
 ZMG_idea_3_desc: "Before it was known as Varniai, our Western capital was called Medininkai, established on the banks of the Varnele river. It became the seat of the Samogitian Bishops, and remained a cultural center with such distinguished residents as Mikalojus Daukša, the first man to publish in Lithuanian within the Commonwealth Duchy."
 ZMG_idea_4: "Victory Against the Orders"
 ZMG_idea_4_desc: "Samogitia, sandwiched between the Teutonic and Livonian Order, seemed ripe for conquest - however, when the armies entered they returned decisively defeated on several occasions by the skilled Samogitian armies. One defeat at Saule in 1236 was so severe for the Livonian Brothers of the Sword that they were forced to seek protection from the Teutonic Order, effectively ending their independence."
 ZMG_idea_5: "Rooted Pagan Beliefs"
 ZMG_idea_5_desc: "Samogitia was the last great bastion of Paganism before converting to Christianity in 1413. Some populations still even worshipped the old gods up until the 1560s. Resisting conversions from outside powers is necessary for the survival of our unique culture."
 ZMG_idea_6: "Changing Political Landscape"
 ZMG_idea_6_desc: "Samogitia changed hands several times between the crusading orders and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, especially in the 14th and 15th centuries. However, they still kept their distinct autonomy during this period as Duke of Samogitia."
 ZMG_idea_7: "Lithuanian Cultural Revival"
 ZMG_idea_7_desc: "Despite its separation from Vilna, Samogitia was a focal point during the Lithuanian Cultural Revival, a reaction against oppressive Russian occupiers. Books in the Lithuanian language - which had been banned by the Russian Tsar - were smuggled throughout our region."

The Torhousekie Stone Circle and Cairnholy are just some of the ancient ruins that dot Galloway, reassuring our people of the longevity of our state. Let no Scots or Angles lord over Gallovidians!"
 MAF_idea_3: "Gall Gaidheil"
 MAF_idea_3_desc: "Gall Gaidheil literally means 'Foreigner Gaels', attesting to the convergence of several ethnic groups in our lands. The Norse invaders have mixed with the local Celtic population."
 MAF_idea_4: "Fergus of Galloway"
 MAF_idea_4_desc: "Fergus was our greatest leader, and a statesman of considerable repute. By arranging a marriage with the Crovans, he became their agnatic progenitor, and then forged alliances with the English to stave over Scottish power. His actions, diplomatically, militarily, and ecclesiastically, are prolific - we should all aspire to emulate him."
 MAF_idea_5: "Battle of the Standard"
 MAF_idea_5_desc: "August 22nd, 1138 saw a great battle between David of Scotland and the Kingdom of England. David had invaded England at the head of a large army, and it was Galloway boys who were at the front of the first charge. Though the battle was a catastrophic failure, with nearly all of the Scottish army being wiped out, it proved the unwavering fearlessness of our troops."
 MAF_idea_6: "Castle Douglas"
 MAF_idea_6_desc: "The Douglases were invested with the Lordship of Galloway in the 1300s under Archibald the Grim. The Douglases improved Galloway's infrastructure, eventually building a familial castle from which to control the countryside. From this powerbase, they earned the moniker 'Black Douglases' and were a thorn in the side of the Royal domain."
 MAF_idea_7: "Belted Galloway"

Though some sail around the Jutland peninsula, our rivers and cities like Sønderborg and Husum facilitate quick goods transfer between different fleets."
 SVG_idea_2: "Angles, Saxons, and Jutes"
 SVG_idea_2_desc: "In antiquity and the early Medieval era, Jutland was home to a staggering amount of tribes, and was the original homeland of several of the barbarians who would go on to divide Rome. While the Angles and Saxons departed for the British Isles, the Jutes and Frisians stayed behind, keeping Schleswig as a multiethnic region to the present."
 SVG_idea_3: "Restore the Danevirke"
 SVG_idea_3_desc: "Centuries ago, our ancestors built a series of fortifications along our southern border, to keep the Germans from overrunning our territory. Though it has fallen into disrepair, the surrounding geography still acts as a bottleneck against the continent, and it would be prudent to restore this ancient bulwark in light of the Treaty of Heiligen which established our border with Charlemagne and his successors."
 SVG_idea_4: "Ties to Holstein"
 SVG_idea_4_desc: "Under the rule of the Abel dynasty, the dukes of Schleswig fostered close connections with the Germans over the border in Holstein. With these friends in high places, we can exert more of an influence within the Holy Roman Empire."
 SVG_idea_5: "Establish Condominium"
 SVG_idea_5_desc: "Condominium refers to the holding of a territory by multiple simultaneous rulers. Schleswig experienced this under the house of Oldenburg, Haderslev, and Holstein-Gottorp, fracturing into many enclaved fiefs. While this may seem damaging, it also heightened Schleswig's defense as multiple powerful houses held stakes."
 SVG_idea_6: "Archdeaconry of Haderslev"
 SVG_idea_6_desc: "In the wake of the Protestant Reformation, an autonomous archdeaconry was created at Haderslev out of the former unified diocese of Schleswig. Along with Ribe, this archdeaconry used Danish for its services as opposed to the more ubiquitous German."
 SVG_idea_7: "Land Tenure Reforms"
 SVG_idea_7_desc: "A series of reforms across the 18th and 19th centuries gradually eroded the old systems of serfdom and forced labor, culminating with the tenure reforms of 1805. At last, peasants could own their own farms, entering into Schleswig's economy."

 PTH_idea_2: "Frederician Professional Army"

 PTH_idea_3: "Pruthenian Tolerance"
 PTH_idea_3_desc: "The Pruthenian Monarchs were religiously tolerant and kept civil strife within their regions to a bare minimum. This gave Pruthenia an opportunity to start the recovery from the 30-years war earlier than most other players."
 PTH_idea_4: "Rise of Pruthenian Military"
 PTH_idea_4_desc: "Pruthenia started rising in its military power around these years, and has remained militaristic and strong for the rest of its years."
 PTH_idea_5: "Noble Officers"
 PTH_idea_5_desc: "Frederick William I restricted enrollment in the officer corps to Germans of noble descent and compelled the Junkers, the Prussian landed aristocracy, to serve in the army, Although initially reluctant about the army, the nobles eventually saw the officer corps as its natural profession."

 PTH_idea_7_desc: "The defeat of the disorganized army during the Napoleonic Wars shocked the Prussian establishment, which had largely felt invincible after the Frederician victories. While Stein and Hardenberg began modernizing the Prussian state, Scharnhorst began to reform the military. He led a Military Reorganization Committee, which included Gneisenau, Grolman, Boyen, and the civilians Stein and Könen. Clausewitz assisted with the reorganization as well. Dismayed by the populace's indifferent reaction to the 1806 defeats, the reformers wanted to cultivate patriotism within the country."

 taifa_ideas_bonus: "Taifa Ambition"
 taifa_idea_1: "Umayyads"
 taifa_idea_1_desc: "After the death of Mohammed, a succession of new Caliphates emerged to lead the faith. First came the Rashiduns, winning great victories against the Romans, and next the Umayyads, who conquered Spain from its Visigothic lords. In the 750s, a treacherous revolt resulted in the Caliphate's exile to Iberia, called Al-Andalus - the land of the Vandals. The Umayyads ruled our lands until 1031, when their final collapse caused the Taifas to emerge. We must reclaim the Umayyad legacy and reunite the Andals!"
 taifa_idea_2: "Sevillan Diplomacy"
 taifa_idea_2_desc: "The men of Seville had the most success in rapid expansion at the expense of their neighbors, due to their adept diplomatic tricks and realpolitik. The Sevillans would hire mercenaries from Muslims and Christians alike, and play their enemies against each other, even allying with heathens."
 taifa_idea_3: "Muladi and Saqaliba"
 taifa_idea_3_desc: "Slavs may seem like the last group to turn up in an Andalusian Taifa, but they were actually a significant population in the Middle Ages. Brought over as slaves, these Saqaliba sometimes worked their way up to sovereign Taifa rule. In addition, large parts of our state populations are made up of mixed ethnicities - Berbers, Arabs, and converted Iberians living and working together."
 taifa_idea_4: "Islamic Scholarship"
 taifa_idea_4_desc: "It is not in the halls of Oxford or Milan that the greatest scientists and men of healing walk, but in the halls of Andalusian mosques. From mathematics to astronomy, from anatomy to botany, citizens of our Taifas are always at the cutting edge. Ibn Rushd, Ibn Zuhr, and Khalid ibn Yazid are just some of the towering scientific figures who lived amongst the Moors."
 taifa_idea_5: "Cast off the Parias"
 taifa_idea_5_desc: "As the northern Christian kingdoms became more powerful, they began to impose a tribute called a Paria on the weakened Taifas. It is time we asserted our independence and refused to pay any tribute to domineering neighbors."
 taifa_idea_6: "Andalusian Horses"
 taifa_idea_6_desc: "As early as 450 BC, Andalusian horses were known for their prowess in warfare. Over time, the Celts, Romans, Goths, and Moors developed them further, producing the elegant and hardy breed that exists today. With such noble steeds, the armies of heathenry will not stand a chance."
 taifa_idea_7: "Restore the Cities"
 taifa_idea_7_desc: "Córdoba, Toledo, Granada, Badajoz, Sevilla, Valencia, Zaragoza - each the center of a Taifa powerful in both political clout and cultural sophistication. We must decorate these cities with jeweled mosques and tapestries, promoting our distinctive Moorish architecture across the peninsula."
#South Slavic
 sslav_ideas: "South Slavic Ideas"
 sslav_ideas_start: "South Slavic Traditions"
 sslav_ideas_bonus: "South Slavic Ambition"
 sslav_idea_1: "Old Church Slavonic"
 sslav_idea_1_desc: "Old Church Slavonic was the first Slavic literary language, created with the help of the Byzantine missionaries Cyril and Methodius. It is from this Cyril that the Cyrillic alphabet emerged, and from whence its Greek connections come. It was primarily used for religious purposes, and helped foster our devout conversion from our old heathenish ways."
 sslav_idea_2: "Byzantine Raids"
 sslav_idea_2_desc: "For centuries, the Southern Slavs made a living off raiding the Romans across the Danube, taking advantage of the empire's perpetual distraction. These raids soon turned into large scale settlement, and by the seventh and eighth century the Byzantines had been pushed all the way back to only their largest and most impenetrable coastal cities."
 sslav_idea_3: "Autokefalna"
 sslav_idea_3_desc: "With the waning of Greek Patriarchal authority, many self-governing churches sprang up across the Balkans. The Bosnians, for example, separated from both Rome and Constantinople, surviving multiple Crusades and attempts by Hungary to impose Catholic rule. We must join with our Slavic brethren and establish our own autocephalous church."
 sslav_idea_4: "Adriatic Trade"
 sslav_idea_4_desc: "The Adriatic Sea opened the Slavs up to lucrative trading opportunities with Latin Italy, especially the Republic of Venice. The Venetians captured many important coastal cities, but these incursions will only boost our economic power if we take proper advantage of them."
 sslav_idea_5: "Dušanov Zakonik"
 sslav_idea_5_desc: "Dusan's Code, crafted in the 1340s by Stefan Dušan the Great, codified the laws of the Serbian Empire and its successive Serbian Despotate. As an early example of a constitution, this legal codex stands as an inspiration to all Southern Slavs. We can adopt its principles for usage in our own state."
 sslav_idea_6: "Rum Millet"
 sslav_idea_6_desc: "Under the pressure of the Ottomans, hope was found in the establishment of the Millet system. The Ottomans permitted a degree of religious self-governance, with most of the Balkan Slavs falling under the Orthodox 'Rum Millet'. We can bolster our shared cultural identity over feast days and liturgy, as the Ottomans prefer Slavic Christianity to the grasp of Rome."
 sslav_idea_7: "Nationalism"
 sslav_idea_7_desc: "In the age of Revolutions and Enlightenment, the Balkan Peninsula, and specifically the Slavs, were a hotbed of ethno-nationalism. The Prussian statesman Otto von Bismarck predicted in the late 1800s that if a world war were to break out, it would be over something that happened in the Balkans."
#Hungarian Ducal

 hunduc_ideas_bonus: "Hungarian Ducal Ambition"
 hunduc_idea_1: "Hercegség"
 hunduc_idea_1_desc: "Before the era of the oligarchs, there was nevertheless a precedent for Magyar ducal rule. An entity simply known as 'The Duchy', and consisting of scattered titles throughout the kingdom, was given in appanage to relatives of the Árpád monarchs until 1107."
 hunduc_idea_2: "Rule of the Oligarchs"
 hunduc_idea_2_desc: "Upon the fall of House Árpád in 1301, ambitious nobles from around Hungary achieved de-facto independence. This period of anarchy was known as the 'Rule of the Oligarchs', or 'Tartományúr'. We must usurp as many royal prerogatives as we can if we are to keep up with the other Oligarch's states!"
 hunduc_idea_3: "Magyar Tactics"
 hunduc_idea_3_desc: "We may be quite separated from those original Magyars who brought Dacia to its knees, but their military stratagems live on within us. One more time shall the Magyar cavalry ride across the plains of Eastern Europe, exacting tribute from our cowering neighbors."
 hunduc_idea_4: "Establish Banates"
 hunduc_idea_4_desc: "The Royal realm made extensive use of buffer states along the Carpathian mountains and the Danube, establishing various semi-independent polities under the rule of an appointed 'Ban', usually from a local noble family but sometimes from the core Magyar lands. We should implement this tactic in our own lands to hold the precarious borderlands."
 hunduc_idea_5: "Cuman Settlers"
 hunduc_idea_5_desc: "Over the centuries many steppe tribes occupied the Carpathian basin, from Avars to Khabars to our own Magyars. As the Cumans moved westward under the threat of Mongol invasion, they were offered organized settlement opportunities by the Hungarians. By letting them settle we will increase our fighting population."
 hunduc_idea_6: "Magyarországi Református Egyház"
 hunduc_idea_6_desc: "The Synod of Debrecen in 1567 issued a Helvetic Confession, seeding Calvinism throughout Hungary. Separated from Rome by the Ottoman Empire, and alienated by an aloof Austrian aristocracy, this adoption of Reformed faith reunited the drifting Magyar populations."
 hunduc_idea_7: "1848 Revolution"
 hunduc_idea_7_desc: "As the fire of revolution swept across Europe in 1848, Hungary was not spared, and the entire former Kingdom declared its independence from Austria. In this spirit of national pride and self-rule, we must be unwavering in the face of further foreign imperialists, like Lajos Kossuth and Artúr Görgei."
#Wallachian Ducal

 walduc_ideas_start: "Wallachian Ducal Traditions"
 walduc_ideas_bonus: "Wallachian Ducal Ambition"
 walduc_idea_1: "We Were Romans"
 walduc_idea_1_desc: "In AD 106 Trajan conquered the Dacians and subsumed the trans-Danubian region into the Empire. Though the Romans later retreated, their Latin tongue has lived on amongst the Vlach peoples. It is from this direct line that Vlachs would later go on to take the name 'Romania'."
 walduc_idea_2: "Radu Negru"
 walduc_idea_2_desc: "Often connected with Basarab I, Radu Negru is the legendary founder of the Wallachian Principality at the turn of the fourteenth century, ending the dominance of the Hungarian Voivodes. We must aspire to unite Wallachia under one banner as Radu is said to have done."
 walduc_idea_3: "Battle of Posada"
 walduc_idea_3_desc: "The enormous Kingdom of Hungary attempted to subjugate the Wallachian people in the 1300s, sending 30,000 troops with King Charles at the head. A tiny force of cavalry and local peasants met the challenge, crushing the Hungarian army in a devastating ambush. This decisive victory engenders our national ethos."
 walduc_idea_4: "Order of the Dragon"
 walduc_idea_4_desc: "The Order of the Dragon was a noble organization founded by King Sigismund of Hungary, and modeled after the old Crusading orders. Many prominent Vlachs were members of the order, and it inspired the name of the house Draculesti. The Draculesti and Danesti voivodes would dominate Wallachia for centuries."
 walduc_idea_5: "Boyar Compromises"
 walduc_idea_5_desc: "Boyars are the Vlach nobility, and their interference in politics was a constant threat. By coming to a compromise with them, allowing certain rights and privileges, we can focus on internal stability. This model was used by Radu IV to great effect, making his principality the envy of the other Romanian states."
 walduc_idea_6: "Curtea de Arges Cathedral"
 walduc_idea_6_desc: "Dedicated to Saint Nicholas, this cathedral was inspired by Byzantine and Islamic architecture and remains an impressive icon of Wallachian Orthodoxy."
 walduc_idea_7: "Reorganize the Counties"
 walduc_idea_7_desc: "Wallachia has long been divided into major regions such as Oltenia and Muntenia. We should break down and redraw our administrative divisions to allow for a more smooth management of the Vlach lands and local minorities."
#Marches

 marches_ideas_bonus: "Cambro-Norman Ambition"
 marches_idea_1: "Clawdd Offa"
 marches_idea_1_desc: "Offa's Dyke was built by an Anglo-Saxon king of Mercia centuries ago. The earthworks now establish the border between Wales and England - the same border we have bravely ventured out over."
 marches_idea_2: "Appointed by England"
 marches_idea_2_desc: "The land conquered from the native Welsh petty kings has been organized into Earldoms, with each Earl invested by the King of England into a hereditary position. With the backing of the most powerful force in the British Isles, we too can dominate the political landscape of these strange Celtic lands."
 marches_idea_3: "Sicut Regale Rulers"
 marches_idea_3_desc: "Compared to normal English fiefs, we have extensive freedoms. Royal Writ does not apply in our frontier holdings, and we instead rule 'sicut regale' - 'ling a king'. We can build our own castles, administer laws, declare wars, establish Market Towns, maintain our own chanceries, confiscate lands, hold trials, and appoint our own sheriffs."
 marches_idea_4: "Roger Mortimer"
 marches_idea_4_desc: "Roger Mortimer was the most powerful of the Marcher Lords, holding extensive allodial titles across Wales and Ireland. He became so powerful, he effectively ruled England in tandem with his mistress Isabella - the wife of the English King Edward II. Eventually, Edward's son built up enough support to wrestle back control of his kingdom from Mortimer, and had him executed, sparing his mother's life. Ironic - he could save others from death, but not himself."
 marches_idea_5: "Foreign Settlers"
 marches_idea_5_desc: "It was not just the Anglo-Normans who conquered and settled South Wales. Many invested Earls were brought directly from mainland France, but also from Brittany and Flanders. Our lands are thus comprised of a coalition of foreign and domestic populations, each with their unique strengths they provide to the state."
 marches_idea_6: "Geoffrey of Monmouth"
 marches_idea_6_desc: "He who controls the past, controls the future. He who controls the present, controls the past. Geoffrey of Monmouth is the greatest of our Cambro-Norman historians, famous for his work on Arthurian legend. Historia Regum Britanniae remains the definitive work on the history of our realm."
 marches_idea_7: "Council of Wales"
 marches_idea_7_desc: "Edward IV needed to properly administer Wales even long after his eponymous ancestor's conquests. In 1472 he established the Council of Wales and the Marches, a regional governing body originally headed by important Bishops. Wales thus had a degree of internal governance far beyond its integration."
#Polish Ducal
 polduc_ideas: "Polish Ducal Ideas"
 polduc_ideas_start: "Polish Ducal Traditions"
 polduc_ideas_bonus: "Polish Ducal Ambition"
 polduc_idea_1: "Testament of Boleslaw Wrymouth"
 polduc_idea_1_desc: "The 1138 will of Boleslaw III, called 'Wrymouth' for his deformed jaw, divided the recently-strengthened Kingdom of Poland amongst his sons. It was from this division that all polish Duchies emerged, setting in motion centuries of internal conflicts and intrigues. We owe our existence to Boleslaw's vision."
 polduc_idea_2: "Ethnic Backgrounds"
 polduc_idea_2_desc: "Before the unification of Poland into one Christian state, there were Slavic tribal units in its present lands. The Silesians, Mazovians, Vistulans, Polans, and Pomeranians were the main powers, and they each live on in the names of our duchies. Though the distinctions have blurred, we are essentially nominal ethnostates."
 polduc_idea_3: "The Seniorate"
 polduc_idea_3_desc: "Boleslaw's testament didn't just divide Poland - it decreed a system of hierarchy, with one province centered on Kraków known as the 'Seniorate', as it was always ruled by the oldest heir and had nominal suzerainty of the other states. To push our interests, we could perhaps bend these rules and find some claim to senior privileges ourselves."
 polduc_idea_4: "Ties With the Germans"
 polduc_idea_4_desc: "Poland's interaction with the German Holy Roman Empire was extensive, though obviously strongest in the east and south. The Silesian duchies entered into a vassal relationship with Bohemia, while the Pomeranians joined the Empire as well under the influence of Brandenburg. These ties mean our royal houses have extensively intermarried, and our trade relations are tight."
 polduc_idea_5: "Divide for Appanage"
 polduc_idea_5_desc: "After the original division of Poland, the sub-duchies were again divided into even smaller territories. Kujavia emerged from Mazovia, Greater Poland produced Kalisz, Gniezno, and various smaller states. In the end, the smaller dukes had less power projection but could more closely administer their lands."
 polduc_idea_6: "Magdeburg Law"
 polduc_idea_6_desc: "The Magdeburg Laws were perhaps the most important in medieval European administration, dealing with the autonomy and rights of individual cities. Under these laws, Poland was urbanized with more modern infrastructure and thousands of villages were founded. Even major preexisting cities like Poznan benefited from the introduction of these laws."
 polduc_idea_7: "Janusz Mazowiecki"
 polduc_idea_7_desc: "Janusz III was the last of the Piast dukes to rule in Poland before being subsumed into the Royal realm. Despite his death, the duchy retained autonomy under its rebellious nobles under 1576, when it was fully integrated by the Jagiellons. We must ensure that our state maintains its own freedoms, and that ambitious Kings will not bend us to their will."
#Wied
 WDX_ideas: "Wieder Ideas"
 WDX_ideas_start: "Wieder Traditions"
 WDX_ideas_bonus: "Wieder Ambition"
 WDX_idea_1: "The Peacock"
 WDX_idea_1_desc: "The Counts of Wied used the peacock as their coat of arms. Peacocks are known for their beautiful plumage and symbolize pride and vanity. The name Wied comes from the nearby Wied river. The castle of the early Counts of Wied, Burg Altwied, had never been conquered. The Counts also were used to leading their troops, having fought in battles to protect the Empire."
 WDX_idea_2: "Keep Good Relations with the Palatinate"
 WDX_idea_2_desc: "The Counts of Wied had always had good relations with the Pfalzgraves, as they had long been fiefs, and even thereafter the Palatinate continued to support Wied. This led to numerous advantages, like receiving Ledigmann as a vassal."
 WDX_idea_3: "Das Recht auf weitgehende Religionsfreiheit"
 WDX_idea_3_desc: "In order to attract more inhabitants to the slow-growing newly-founded city of Neuwied, the Count gave the city in a charter numerous freedoms, including the right to elect their Magistrate or to collect taxes, but most exceptionally for that time, the right to a broad religious freedom. Many people fled from other counties to Neuwied due to religious intolerance. In the 18th century, seven different religious communities lived in Neuwied: Calvinists, Lutherans, Catholics, Mennonites, Inspirationalists, Herrnhuters and Jews."
 WDX_idea_4: "Wetzlarer Punctation"
 WDX_idea_4_desc: "At a certain moment there was a dispute about the municipal revenues between the Count and the Magistrate. Before the trial was finished, an acceptable compromise was made. In the Wetzlarer Punctation, not only were the financial disputes solved, but also the religious and other freedoms were reconfirmed."
 WDX_idea_5: "City of Schools"
 WDX_idea_5_desc: "The Counts of Wied recognized the value of education and encouraged education to the best of their ability. Already in 1616, an edict was issued, which ordered compulsory schooling in the County. Since then Wied has always been a very important center of education with its numerous schools."
 WDX_idea_6: "Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied"
 WDX_idea_6_desc: "Prince Alexander Philipp Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied was an explorer, ethnologist and naturalist. He explored southeast Brazil and the Great Plains. He is most important for his correct depictions and detailed descriptions, mainly about the Brazilian tribes. But he also collected a large number of specimens of flora and fauna, still preserved in a museum. Several plants and animals are named after him."
 WDX_idea_7: "An Early Industrialization"
 WDX_idea_7_desc: "The immigrants, persecuted in other places, brought in many new production goods and skills, giving Wied an economic prosperity and contributed to a comparatively early industrialization. The furniture and watches produced in Neuwied were highly demanded by other courts. But also steel was a very important export product: it was for example used to build the first German railroad."
#Passau
 PAA_ideas: "Passauer Ideas"
 PAA_ideas_start: "Passauer Traditions"
 PAA_ideas_bonus: "Passauer Ambition"
 PAA_idea_1: "Sieben Künische Dörfen"
 PAA_idea_1_desc: "The villages of Wollaberg, Heindlschlag, Hintereben, Jandelsbrunn, Rosenberg, Aßberg and Grund, together with the area of Wilderranna, formed a large enclave and important foothold in the Austrian lands. The Bishops of Passau frequently founded new villages, expanding their territory and influence. Much later, when most of the Passauer land was lost due to the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, the bishops only held some villages they once founded in Bohemia."
 PAA_idea_2: "Not Suitable for Large Armies"
 PAA_idea_2_desc: "Invading armies had difficulties camping in Passau, as the small territory was not rich in food resources, so the resources could easily get exhausted. And if the troops were badly provisioned, they would get hungry even before fall."
 PAA_idea_3: "Confluence of the Inn and the Danube"
 PAA_idea_3_desc: "Passau was located at the confluence of the Inn and the Danube, and because of that it was an important trade city, as it linked the German and Austrian trade. But also the Ilz river is very close, providing a link to the Bohemian lands."
 PAA_idea_4: "Salzfertiger"
 PAA_idea_4_desc: "When laws regulating the salt trade were drawn by Bishop Otto, he ruled that salt which was transported on the Inn had to be stored and offered for sale in Passau for at least three days and it went through several processing stations there which were in the hands of businessmen called Salzfertiger who ran the large warehouses for the salt storage. These merchants established a powerful monopoly against their competition from Bohemia and Austria. After the three days and the customs clearance, the salt could continue its way toward the north and east. Some salt which arrived from the Inn was transported from Passau on the water route upstream to Regensburg and downstream to Vienna."
 PAA_idea_5: "Wall-Pillar Churches"
 PAA_idea_5_desc: "These type of churches already existed, but were rarely used and often only for small churches or as parts of larger buildings. The crucial breakthrough in the creation of the wall-pillar church took place mainly in Passau, as they wanted to erect a lot more churches to impress their rival Salzburg. Wall-pillar churches allowed relatively large, wide areas to be built cheaply and quickly from bricks or rumble."
 PAA_idea_6: "Frequent Visitations of Discipline"
 PAA_idea_6_desc: "More than in other bishoprics, Passau carried many visitations of discipline, life, and morals."
 PAA_idea_7: "Reduction of the Old Diocese of Passau"
 PAA_idea_7_desc: "The Diocese of Passau is much older than the neighboring dioceses, as Passau can be considered as the successor of the ancient Roman diocese of Lorch. It was also one of the earliest states to gain princely powers.\n\nWe are, or to be more correct, were the largest diocese of the Holy Roman Empire, stretching even into Hungary, but the Pope, Austria, Bavaria and all the other neighbors don't seem to care about us, and just took away much of our influence to create more dioceses like Vienna. We should solve this militarily."

 SLZ_idea_1: "Hallein Salt Mine"
 SLZ_idea_1_desc: "The Hallein Salt Mine, also known as Salzbergwerk Dürrnberg, is an underground salt mine located in the Dürrnberg plateau. The mine has been worked for over 7,000 years since the time of the Celtic tribes and earlier. It helped ensure nearby Salzburg would become a powerful trading community; even its name comes from this mined resource."
 SLZ_idea_2: "Wars Against the Magyars"
 SLZ_idea_2_desc: "Salzburg fought difficult wars against the Magyars, who were troublesome to stop. Eventually these invaders were pushed back. We have learned many tactics from these wars, and will perform even better in the future."
 SLZ_idea_3: "Missions Give Territory"
 SLZ_idea_3_desc: "We should invest more in missionary missions, as we can possibly gain more territory that way, like during the missionary missions in the region between the Raba, Danube and Drava rivers. At the end of these missions, a dispute arose between us and Aquileia about the borders, and the Emperor fixed the issue in our advantage!"
 SLZ_idea_4: "Primas Germaniae"
 SLZ_idea_4_desc: "The Primas Germaniae is a title of honor for the most important Roman Catholic bishop in the German lands. Mainz was the first to have this title. Many others also claimed the title; like we, however, they all lost the Primate dignity, leaving us alone to bear this title!"
 SLZ_idea_5: "Convert or Leave"
 SLZ_idea_5_desc: "Protestant tendencies revealed themselves vigorously in the Bishopric, supported and promoted by the Protestant members of the imperial estates. In imitation of the Corpus Evangelicorum, the Lutherans of the Salzburg territory formed a league, binding themselves by oath and an outward rite of mutual sprinkling of salt. The Archbishop did all he could; he invited the Jesuits as missionaries, and engaged the help of the Emperor. Later he enforced the Decree of the Religious Peace of Augsburg: recantation or emigration. In ten years about 30,000 people left the territory and settled in East Prussia, or in Württemberg or Hanoverian territory; a few emigrated to Georgia in North America."
 SLZ_idea_6: "Patrons of World-Famous Musicians"
 SLZ_idea_6_desc: "The Bishops of Salzburg were famed for their patronage of many classical writers. The most famous musicians they ever supported were Mozart and Haydn."
 SLZ_idea_7: "Second-Hand Trade"
 SLZ_idea_7_desc: "The Salzburger government did not attach importance to the complaints of several traders about the reselling of used items causing unfair competition. These lax laws, together with its already large commercial importance, made Salzburg an important center of second-hand trade. It remained unregulated for almost the whole existence of the Salzburger State."

 DDD_idea_1: "Founded by Henry the Lion"
 DDD_idea_1_desc: "The origins of the County go back to the middle of the 12th century, when Henry the Lion founded the five counties of Holstein, Ratzeburg, Schwerin, Dannenberg and Lüchow during the Ostsiedlung or the colonization of the East, from the mouth of the River Elbe to the southern border of the March of Brandenburg, in order to protect the new regions and borders of his territory. The lion in the coat of arms probably refers to this past."
 DDD_idea_2: "Waldemarturm"
 DDD_idea_2_desc: "It is said that the Danish king Valdemar II and his son were captured and held as prisoners in the tower of Dannenberg. This tower received the name of Waldemarturm because of that."
 DDD_idea_3: "The Jeetzel River"
 DDD_idea_3_desc: "The Jeetzel River has the tendency to frequently flood the town of Dannenberg. This caused the town to have a small and stretched shape, but it also provided defence against attackers, as the castle was built close to it."
 DDD_idea_4: "Sankt-Johannis-Kirche"
 DDD_idea_4_desc: "The Saint John's Church of Dannenberg is one of the few old buildings it has, dating from 1385, although it has been renovated many times. Just like nearly everyone converted to Protestantism, this church became a Protestant one."
 DDD_idea_5: "Elbtalaue"
 DDD_idea_5_desc: "Dannenberg is the most important town of the Elbtalaue, which means Elbe Valley. It's a spatially not sharply defined region around the river's middle reaches in northern Germany. It has many lakes and marshlands."
 DDD_idea_6: "The Fire of 1608"
 DDD_idea_6_desc: "In 1608, a major fire struck the town of Dannenberg, destroying all buildings except for the church and the Waldemarturm. There are no buildings left from before the 17th century. This however cleared up space for newer and better buildings."
 DDD_idea_7: "Sold, Recovered, and Lost Again"
 DDD_idea_7_desc: "In the early 14th century, the Duke of Dannenberg sold its County to Lüneburg, ending its existence. In the middle of the 16th century however, some members of another line of the Dannenberg family managed to regain power over a slightly larger independent Dannenberg. But this line soon became extinct in the middle of the 17th century, ending its existence again and going back to Lüneburg."

 DXS_idea_1_desc: "These two local saints were the founders of the Abbey of Disentis. Sigisbert was a wandering Frankish monk, and Placidus was the local landowner who supported Sigisbert. The ruler of Chur, distrusting the two, murdered Placidus to prevent a loss of land. It did not help: Disentis became independent and controlled a very large estate. It is also one of the oldest monasteries of Southern Germany and Switzerland."
 DXS_idea_2: "Quick Mountain Movement"
 DXS_idea_2_desc: "The troops of Disentis were able to surprise attack enemies with their rapidity. Even though they were greatly outnumbered, they were able to do remarkable damage."
 DXS_idea_3: "Trons"
 DXS_idea_3_desc: "Near the secluded village of Trons, somewhere in its thick forests, the best and most hardy men of the surroundings assembled to talk about justice, the love for liberty and humanity. The Abbot favored them with advice and his authority."
 DXS_idea_4: "Lukmanier Pass"
 DXS_idea_4_desc: "The monastery was often the site of hard-fought battles because of its strategic location on a mountain pass, connecting the Leagues to the rest of Switzerland."
 DXS_idea_5: "Founding Member of the Grey League"
 DXS_idea_5_desc: "In an act to stop internal wars and to focus more on defending against expanding empires, the many rulers of the Grischa region formed the Grey League. Disentis had an important role in its formation, and would become a very important member."
 DXS_idea_6: "Divert Trade Away From Gothard"
 DXS_idea_6_desc: "In the tenth century, Disentis controlled the most important passage in a large area. However, the Gothard route was laid, and a lot of the traders went through that route instead of going through Disentis. This marked the end of our prosperity. We should change that and let the trade again go through Disentis."
 DXS_idea_7: "Bibla da Cuera"
 DXS_idea_7_desc: "Disentis used its printing press to spread Romansch spiritual literature, and they also made the first Catholic Romansch Bible, the Bibla da Cuera. Disentis became the cultural center of the Catholic Romansch people."

 TUB_idea_4: "In Debt to Monasteries"
 TUB_idea_4_desc: "The Counts Palatine of Tübingen founded many monasteries, most notably the abbeys of Bebenhausen and of Blaubeuren. But their extravagant donations to these monasteries contributed to the county's economic decline. The control of Böblingen and Calw were transferred to Bebenhausen Abbey. Eventually the most important territories including the city of Tübingen were sold or donated to the abbey, ending the County's existence."
 TUB_idea_5: "Under Württemberger Rule"
 TUB_idea_5_desc: "For centuries Tübingen had been under the rule of the Duchy of Württemberg. This had some side effects, like converting early to Protestantism, being dragged into the many wars of the Duchy, or serving as a military base."
 TUB_idea_6: "Ebenhard Karls University"
 TUB_idea_6_desc: "One of the most significant events in Tübingen's history is the founding of the Ebenhard Karls University by Duke Ebenhard of Württemberg in 1477, making it one of the oldest universities in Central Europe.

 MAG_idea_1: "Magdeburg City Rights"
 MAG_idea_1_desc: "In 1188, archbishop Wichmann granted the city of Magdeburg city privileges, and has since then been adopted by surrounding German cities, but also spread as far as Bohemia and is still spreading further eastwards. As experts we are often called to decide controversial questions regarding the Magdeburg Rights. These rights contain various trade and merchant rights, marital laws, the abolition of kin liability and the installation of a tribunal."
 MAG_idea_2: "Bread House of the Hansa"
 MAG_idea_2_desc: "Beginning from the 13th century, Magdeburg was part of the Hansa and a pivotal center of trade at the Elbe. Also because of the staple right for corn, Magdeburg monopolized the corn trade making it the 'Bread House of the Hansa'."

 MAG_idea_3_desc: "After the adoption of a more evangelical approach to Christianity, we have fought with verve to protect these new teachings have refused to make any concessions even under military pressure. Impressed by our religious zeal, various disciples of this new approach have honored us with the title Ünseres Herrgotts Kanzlei - our lord's chancellery."
 MAG_idea_4: "Forerunning Primas Germaniae"
 MAG_idea_4_desc: "The archbishops of Magdeburg held the title of a Primas Germaniae since a papal bull from 986. Although, there are others holding this title, too, we are the only ones to have adopted the new religious teachings. Therefore, we should use our title to become the forefront of this movement and impose our supremacy!"
 MAG_idea_5: "Risen from Ruins"
 MAG_idea_5_desc: "Our land and city was completely devastated during the so-called Magdeburg Wedding by our intolerant opponents. This coined the phrase Magdeburgization for such a terror. But if we now gave up and dissuaded from the right path, they would ultimately win. Therefore, we will rebuild our city and land to even excel our former glory!"
 MAG_idea_6: "Magdeburg Hemispheres"
 MAG_idea_6_desc: "Since we have dissolved Magdeburg's Abbey of St. Augustine and made the latter's library publicly accessible for our citizens, the pursuit of knowledge has become a goal of a lot of burghers. One example is Otto von Guericke who made an impressive experiment showing how air pressure works and giving another proof for the existence of vacua. To do so, he connected two airtight half spheres and evacuated the hollow space in between with a pump. Thereafter, eight horses on each side weren't able to pull apart the sphere; only after air flowed in again were the horses able to do so."
 MAG_idea_7: "Strongest Northern Fortress"
 MAG_idea_7_desc: "We have to learn the lessons from the past, and take care to prevent getting ravaged by foreign powers again. Thus, we will build the strongest fortress of northern Germany and build drill grounds, so our garrisons will always be prepared for sieges."

 OLD_idea_5: "Abbey Blankenburg Foundation"
 OLD_idea_5_desc: "After we have chosen to follow Luther's teaching, we have dissolved our country's abbeys of which some stand empty. As the poor and orphans had no longer a place to dwell, we have decided to learn from our mistakes and institute a foundation at the former Abbey Blankenburg."
 OLD_idea_6: "Elsether Weserzoll"
 OLD_idea_6_desc: "Although we were granted the privilege to tariff ships passing the toll station at Elseth which is the last toll station before the mouth of the river Weser, the emperor had to help us to bend Bremen's will to accept this toll. Since we have to operate many dikes and a lighthouse at the isle of Wangerooge, this toll seems justified to us. Now, the additional ducats will fill our treasury!"
 OLD_idea_7: "Elevation to a Duchy"
 OLD_idea_7_desc: "Ever since time immemorial, Oldenburg was only a county. But now that we have expanded and claimed other land titles, the time is at hand to proclaim the Duchy of Oldenburg. Now, we will no longer be looked down on by dukes owning less land than we do!"

If at every coronation all of our nobles pledge their allegiance to our ruler, their support of our reign will be guaranteed, legitimizing our sovereignty."
 STY_idea_2: "Military Frontier"
 STY_idea_2_desc: "The defense of our frontiers is a serious issue, not so much how to do it but how to pay for it. The solution we have hit upon it to make generous land grants on the frontier to build up a professional military class. Not only will this ensure our frontier is adequately defended at a reasonable price but these men will be available for other tasks."
 STY_idea_3: "Rezeß von Wien"
 STY_idea_3_desc: "For a long time, there were exclaves of clerical territories amidst Styria. We have been able to negotiate an agreement with the corresponding rulers.

We will found the Inner Austrian Hofkriegsrat in which we will convene and counsel with our territorial estates close to the border. This will help to decide with as much information as possible, so that our defensive actions will be more organized."
 STY_idea_5: "Innerberger Hauptgewerkschaft"
 STY_idea_5_desc: "For a long time our iron industry was decentralized and was split into many different facilities often taking care of only one production step. Whereas, the foundation of the Innerberger Hauptgewerkschaft will lead to the whole production and trade being managed centrally benefiting our iron production."
 STY_idea_6: "Landeszeughaus"
 STY_idea_6_desc: "From now on, our weaponry and military equipment will be stored in the newly built Landeszeughaus of Graz. With its capacity to store equipment for about 16,000 soldiers, it is the biggest armory of the world and will greatly reduce our storage costs."
 STY_idea_7: "Abbey Library Admont"
 STY_idea_7_desc: "A length of 70, a width of 14 and a height of 13 meters make the Abbey Library Admont the biggest monastic library of the world.

 AUG_idea_3_desc: "In 1530 the Confessio Augustana was presented to Emperor Charles IV during an imperial diet which was called as an attempt to restore religious unity in the Holy Roman Empire and fight off the Turks. This was the basis of the new faith also called Protestantism. Let us now accept all Christians regardless of their denomination!"
 AUG_idea_4: "Fuggerei"

A megalithic 203-foot promontory, it is easy to defend from both land and sea invasions, and has been prized since ancient Greek colonists first brought civilization to the area. Francesco Grimaldi's devious capture of the Rock in 1297 by disguising himself as a monk paved the way for the foundation of the Monégasque lordship."
 MCO_idea_2: "English Plunder"
 MCO_idea_2_desc: "During the Hundred Years' War conflict between England and France, the rulers of Monaco participated on the side of their continental overlord. During the English Channel naval campaign of 1338, Monaco helped sack Southampton and brought many English riches back to the capital."
 MCO_idea_3: "Monégasque Dialect"
 MCO_idea_3_desc: "Though it falls within the Ligurian family of Italian languages, Monégasque also has French influences, and is known to be quite similar to the Niçard dialect to its west. The language of our people thus bridges the gap between different cultures, and attests to our position at the crossroads of empires."
 MCO_idea_4: "Palazzo dei Principi"
 MCO_idea_4_desc: "To increase the prestige of our state, Lord Honoré II sought the elevation of Monaco to a Principality, a privileged rank afforded to few rulers in Europe. He renovated the Rock by constructing the Princely Palace, complete with robust defenses, a chapel, pool, mirror gallery, and priceless artwork like Murano chandeliers and Jan Brueghel paintings. With a princely title, kingship is almost within our grasp!"
 MCO_idea_5: "Treaty of Péronne"
 MCO_idea_5_desc: "The deft political maneuvering of Prince Honoré II also led to Monaco securing its independence not only from domineering Spain but also from the more immediately threatening France. The treaty was signed on September 14th, 1641, and added a level of de-jure nationhood onto our already de-facto sovereign status."
 MCO_idea_6: "Risorgimento"
 MCO_idea_6_desc: "Italian Unification had a profound effect on Monaco. Several cities, such as Menton and Roquebrune, revolted against the Prince in an attempt to federate with the rest of Italy. Though they were ultimately annexed to France in the Treaty of 1861, Monte Carlo and Monaco itself were reconfirmed in their sovereign independent status. Like San Marino, we escaped the fate that befell virtually every other Italian city."
 MCO_idea_7: "Casino de Monte-Carlo"
 MCO_idea_7_desc: "Incorporating a casino in our largest community under a puppet company - le Société des bains de mer de Monaco - will funnel profits straight to the ruling family. Sumptuous and expertly planned, the casino is the brainchild of Princess Caroline and will attract some of the richest figures in Europe to our small state. Never forget, the house always wins."

 NIC_idea_2: "River Paillon"

 NIC_idea_3: "Promote Italian"
 NIC_idea_3_desc: "Since the Roman conquest of Nice, Latin has been used by the elite class for administrative matters. In 1561 the Duke of Savoy, Emanuele Filiberto, decided to abolish the use of Latin in favor of the local Italian dialect, creating a more transparent and uniquely Italic government."
 NIC_idea_4: "Liberoscambismo"

 NIC_idea_6: "Garibaldi's Birthplace"
 NIC_idea_6_desc: "Giuseppe Garibaldi is one of the most important figures in the history of Italy, standing alongside the likes of Julius Caesar and Theoderic. His nationalist campaign of 'Risorgimento' led to the unification of the peninsula under one flag for the first time in centuries, and he himself was a native of Nice. Giuseppe was always fond of his birthplace and opposed its annexation by France."
 NIC_idea_7: "Between Two Worlds"
 NIC_idea_7_desc: "For a long time, Nice has sat at the crossroads of France and Italy, poised just beneath the end of the Alps between the Comte de Provence and the Ducato di Savoia.

 LAN_idea_3: "Birthplace of the Renaissance"
 LAN_idea_3_desc: "The writings of Dante Alighieri and Petrarch in the 14th century brought forward a resurgence in interest and rebirth in long-lost Classical thought: the Renaissance.

 LAN_idea_5: "Machiavellian Secularism"
 LAN_idea_5_desc: "'Religions are man-made, but integral to the functioning of a society', so were the words of Machiavelli. Born in Florence, Niccolò Machiavelli and his Philosophical writings brought countless new concepts to us, from aspects of Humanism, to an understanding of religion."
 LAN_idea_6: "Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore"
 LAN_idea_6_desc: "Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore: 'Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Flower', is the symbol of the grandeur of Firenze and our symbol to show Rome the religious devotion of Florence and its' people.

 ORA_idea_2: "Orange University"
 ORA_idea_2_desc: "Many European cities hold their university as a point of pride, from Bologna to Oxford to Warsaw. Orange University has a particular significance in that it was founded by the Holy Roman Emperor Karl IV himself when visiting Arles to be crowned King of Burgundy in 1365."

 ORA_idea_4: "Van Oranje"
 ORA_idea_4_desc: "By far the most famous contribution of Orange is its provision of the royal dynasty of the Netherlands. In 1544 William the Silent of Nassau, who would go on to be a Dutch ruler, inherited Orange and took its name, founding the illustrious house of Orange-Nassau, or 'van Oranje'. This house would even rule the Kingdom of England."
 ORA_idea_5: "Huguenot Stronghold"

 LOO_idea_2: "Reginar and Balderik"
 LOO_idea_2_desc: "In the era of prehistory, Loon was not a contiguous entity but rather a mess of personal holdings, constantly splitting and morphing. This changed in the eleventh century when the present county was founded by two households both alike in dignity: the house of Reginar and the house of Balderik. Both stretch back to the Carolingian era."
 LOO_idea_3: "Liègeoise Connections"

 LOO_idea_4_desc: "With modest origins, Averbode came to be one of the most significant abbacies in the region, holding 5500 hectares of land and training countless clerics and monks. It had been founded in 1134 by Arnold, a count of Loon, and its position at the county's border testified to this generous endowment."
 LOO_idea_5: "Invest in Hasselt"
 LOO_idea_5_desc: "Loon's ancient capital was the eponymous city of Loon or Looz, while Hasselt stood as a close second within the county's confines. As Hasselt continued to grow, however, it became the new administrative center for the state, and would even rival Maastricht in its regional governance."
 LOO_idea_6: "Common Loon"
 LOO_idea_6_desc: "Gavia Immer, also known as the Common Loon, populates lakes and waterways across the Old and New worlds. It is universally beloved for its noble nature, haunting call, and striking black-and-white plumage. Though the etymology comes from unrelated Germanic words, we should be proud to share a name with this bird."
 LOO_idea_7: "Belgian Nationalism"
 LOO_idea_7_desc: "In the nineteenth century, the Lowlands were fractured between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the newly-formed Kingdom of Belgium, a Catholic state of Flemings, Walloons, and other minor ethnic groups. Loon was fiercely dedicated to the Belgian side, and the local administrative region was actually split to allow Loon to remain within Belgium."

 POB_idea_1: "Guarnito d'Appiano"
 POB_idea_1_desc: "The earliest ancestor of Piombino's royal family was Guarnito d'Appiano, who appeared as a notary in the Republic of Pisa in the early thirteenth century. The family he started was endlessly ambitious, first rising up the ranks of notary guilds, then attaining governmental positions within Pisa, and finally becoming leaders of the Republic."
 POB_idea_2: "Etruscan Origins"
 POB_idea_2_desc: "Many cities across the Western world boast of their Roman origins. Piombino, on the other hand, has a pedigree reaching back before the Romans themselves to the Etruscan civilization. The area was known to the Etruscans as Populonia, and was one of their most important ports."
 POB_idea_3: "Elba"
 POB_idea_3_desc: "The jewel in the crown of Piombino is the island of Elba, which has been coveted since the Hellenistic era. The island's capital earned the name Portoferraio due to its rich metal deposits, and the island's defenses were so respected that it was chosen as the prison-house for Napoléon upon his first defeat."
 POB_idea_4: "Fortify Against Piracy"
 POB_idea_4_desc: "Though one does not think of the Barbary Coast as falling near Tuscany, Barbary pirates nevertheless devastated Elba, Piombino, and nearby surroundings with their raids. We must fortify against these raging infidels with coastal fortresses - construct the Torre Mozza and redouble the strength of our city walls!"
 POB_idea_5: "Thalassocratic State"
 POB_idea_5_desc: "Holding territories only on the immediate coast and on islands, Piombino is the ideal thalassocratic state. Our sailors are well-trained, and our navies have an edge over the inland city-states occupying the rest of Tuscany."
 POB_idea_6: "Lucca e Piombino"
 POB_idea_6_desc: "At the time of Napoléon, our state was merged with Lucca to form a new principality. The significance of this action cannot be understated - thousands of sovereign polities met their end with Napoléon and his mediatization, but Piombino was significant enough to continue on in joint rule, under Napoléon's sister Elisa no less."
 POB_idea_7: "Piombinesi Industry"
 POB_idea_7_desc: "The hinterland around Piombino is ripe for industrial exploitation. Let factory farms rise in the fertile fields, and where they cannot, let great coal processing factories spew out smoke until all the fields are in shadow, and the farmers can farm in the shade!"

 VMG_idea_1_desc: "Ventimiglia has the privilege of not only being a commune and a city but also the seat of its own Bishopric, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ventimiglia. This is not a recent creation, but rather has stood since the seventh century when a Bishop Giovanni is recorded."
 VMG_idea_2: "Lascaris di Ventimiglia"
 VMG_idea_2_desc: "In 1261 the reigning count of Ventimiglia, Guglielmo Pietro I, married the daughter of the Laskarid Emperor of Byzantium. From then on, all counts of Ventimiglia have been cognatic descendants of this legendary Byzantine dynasty. Like the Palaiologoi of Montferrat, Roman blood runs through our veins."
 VMG_idea_3: "San Michele Arcangelo"
 VMG_idea_3_desc: "In the tenth century, the counts of Ventimiglia converted a Pagan temple to a Christian church, dedicating it to Saint Michael. Now the Benedictines inhabit it, and it would reflect well on us if we funded its restoration in the newer Romanesque style."
 VMG_idea_4: "Invest in Tenda"
 VMG_idea_4_desc: "After Ventimiglia was lost to Provence, the brothers Guglielmo Pietro and Pietro Balbo moved the administrative center of the state to the inland city of Tenda, which had been a lordship under the pre-Lascarid rulers. Though Ventimiglia remained the official name, many knew the state as the 'County of Tenda', nestled in a more easily defensible alpine position."
 VMG_idea_5: "Angevin-Savoyard Diplomacy"
 VMG_idea_5_desc: "Ventimiglia became something akin to a buffer state between the Angevin county of Provence and the extensive Duchy of Savoy in its later centuries. The Counts thus had to play each side against each other, sometimes acknowledging the rule of one, and sometimes the other."
 VMG_idea_6: "Col de Tende"
 VMG_idea_6_desc: "Separating the Maritime Alps and the Ligurian Alps, the Col de Tende is a high mountain pass between Italy and France. Its roots are as ancient as the region's Hellenistic colonies, and we should use it to our advantage, exacting tolls for its continued maintenance."
 VMG_idea_7: "Last French Conquest"
 VMG_idea_7_desc: "Over the centuries France carved out much land that had been traditionally aligned with Italy, including an exchange that saw the original Savoyard lands themselves lost to the house of Savoy. Tenda, the later capital of our county, was the last Italian commune to ever join the French Republic."

He became a chancellor of the Empire and the Granvelle family was going to reach the best places at the Imperial court. The Granvelle palace which was created in Besançon was ruled by the Granvelle family. It is a symbol of their glory."
 BSC_idea_5: "Vauban's Masterpiece"
 BSC_idea_5_desc: "After the French took the city, Vauban was assigned to fortify the place. He naturally chose to put a fort at the mount Saint-Étienne, confirming the site's strategic importance that Julius Caesar recognized as early as 58 BC."
 BSC_idea_6: "Claude de Jouffroy d'Abbans"
 BSC_idea_6_desc: "Claude de Jouffroy d'Abbans (1751-1832) was the inventor of the steamboat and the paddle steamer. The first steamboat sailed originally on the Doubs (the river passing through Besançon) in July 1776."

 TIR_idea_4_desc: "We are on a land that is highly divided and we know that we can't fight with all of the nations that have a border with us. So we must keep close ties with our Austrian brothers. That way, we will not be alone in these highly divided lands."
 TIR_idea_5: "Neighboring With Italy"

 TIR_idea_6: "Condottieri From Italy"
 TIR_idea_6_desc: "Everybody has a talent. And Italians' talent is being mercenaries. They fight war to war for money and they don't complain a single time. Currently there are too many Italian mercenaries, but because we are close to Italy, we can benefit from these mercenaries by hiring them."
 TIR_idea_7: "Harsh Alpine Winter"
 TIR_idea_7_desc: "Winter is an enemy for every nation that is in a war. But winters in the Alps are ten times more severe. It creates too many troubles for the nations who dare to cross the Alps. Because of this, we must use the Alps to create attrition for our enemies."

 DAU_idea_3: "Founding New Cities"
 DAU_idea_3_desc: "We can't improve just one city; all of our glorious nation must be prosperous. We must found new cities and make small cities larger. We showed the world that we can do it when we made Grenoble our capital instead of Vienne, and we can continue this for sure."

 VGT_idea_1_desc: "Around 1180, Frederick I conferred the title 'Advocatus' to the Lords of Weida, 'Vogt' in German meaning 'Bailiff'. The title was continued by all branches during the division of the parent house and passed on like a hereditary imperial fief. The importance of the Vögte was of such great value that the local land today bears the name 'Vogtland'."
 VGT_idea_2: "Heinrichinger"
 VGT_idea_2_desc: "The members of the House of Reuß were Vögte of Weida, Gera and Plauen and were appointed by Emperor Henry VI - in his honor all male descendants received the name Henry. For this reason, the name Heinrichinger is also customary for the ruling dynasty. Henry LXXIII ruled as Count Reuß zu Köstritz from 1851 to 1855. Who keeps track of all these Henrys?"
 VGT_idea_3: "Vogtland War"
 VGT_idea_3_desc: "While the heads of the Vogt families of Weida, Gera and Plauen had still acted uniformly in external terms until the middle of the 13th century, they fell victim to the expansive efforts of their neighbours, the Margraves of Meissen and the Kings of Bohemia: the Vögte of Weida and Gera joined the Wettins, while the Vögte of Plauen went under Bohemian feudal rule in 1327. In the Vogtland War of 1354-57, the Vögte of Weida, Gera and Plauen lost most of their property to Emperor Charles IV and the Wettins. With strong allies, we must reclaim what is rightfully ours."
 VGT_idea_4: "Instrument Makers"
 VGT_idea_4_desc: "The instruments from the so-called Musikwinkel with the cities of Markneukirchen and Klingenthal in Upper Vogtland have literally an excellent sound. 80 percent of the orchestral instruments produced in the world came from Vogtland until the Second World War. Around 1910, Markneukirchen was the richest city in Germany in relation to the number of inhabitants and had its own American consulate for thriving exports."
 VGT_idea_5: "Plauener Spitze"
 VGT_idea_5_desc: "The origin of Plauen Lace was the refinement of smooth cotton fabrics using satin stitch embroidery, which began at the beginning of the 19th century. Later, tulle was also stitched. Only the introduction of the shuttle embroidery machine in 1883 accelerated the mechanical production of tulle and etched lace. Today, this brand represents less a certain type of lace but functions primarily as a quality seal and umbrella brand for all regionally produced embroidery products."
 VGT_idea_6: "Bäderfünfeck"
 VGT_idea_6_desc: "The Vogtland is regarded as one of the most volcanically active zones in Central Europe. Signs of this are swarm earthquakes, hot springs and gas leaks. The healing springs have allowed the health resorts of Bad Elster and Bad Brambach to flourish with the strongest radium mineral spring in the world. With Marienbad, Franzensbad and Karlsbad on the Czech-Bohemian side, the two Saxon national spas form the so-called Bäderfünfeck."

The origin of the festival goes back to the year 836 when the relics of St. Liborius of Le Mans were brought from France to the bishop's town of Paderborn as part of the then customary relic translations. When the group of clergymen, who had left for Le Mans, reached Paderborn again, this happened with great participation of the people."
 PAD_idea_4: "Haxter Warte"
 PAD_idea_4_desc: "The Haxter Warte is a 15th-century tower built southeast of Paderborn and part of the Landwehr. The watchtower could not hold back a determined enemy, but rather served as an 'early warning system' for the main city defence."
 PAD_idea_5: "Kümpe"
 PAD_idea_5_desc: "It was the fire catastrophe of 1506, which destroyed 300 houses, that caused the Paderborner Council to take preventive fire protection measures and to fundamentally improve the fire-fighting water supply, even away from springs and river arms. The force of the flowing water of the Pader river was transferred via a water wheel to a piston pump, which transported water artificially uphill via a wooden pipe system to the higher parts of the town. There were large stone basins, so-called Kümpe, from which the people of Paderborn could draw water for extinguishing, but of course also for their everyday needs."
 PAD_idea_6: "Cautio Criminalis"
 PAD_idea_6_desc: "With this Latin work, the Catholic poet and Jesuit Friedrich Spee opposed the practice of the witch trials and made a decisive contribution to the end of witchcraft in Germany by means of perceptive argumentation and clever rhetoric. He did not question that people might have magical abilities with the help of the devil. But in order to recognize such witches and magicians in individual cases, the procedures used in witch trials are not suitable. With the physical torments of torture, everyone could be forced to make a confession."

 WRM_idea_6: "Protestants Undesirable"

With the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, the Protestants were accepted. However, only as a result of the 'Brucker Libells' of 1578, in which the nobility rejected Calvinism, Archduke Charles II granted religious freedom in Inner Austria under pressure of the nobility. This entailed not only the toleration of Protestantism but also that almost all of Carinthia was Protestant at the end of the 16th century. The province is still, alongside Burgenland, a stronghold of Protestantism in Austria, which was mainly able to survive in remote valleys."

 CTH_idea_4_desc: "Klagenfurt's Lindwurmbrunnen is the landmark of our capital and a reminder of the city's foundation. The monumental sculpture shows a wyvern with its mouth open, from which water flows, and its wings laid on. The shell is punched, its tail is artistically curved. Allegedly, the work, weighing 6 tons, was transported to the town square by 300 juveniles dressed in white after its completion."
 CTH_idea_5: "Carinthian Silver Mining"
 CTH_idea_5_desc: "Silver was Carinthia's second most important raw material after iron. It played a special role in the Middle Ages and early modern times and supported the prosperity that Carinthia enjoyed during the Reformation."
 CTH_idea_6: "Carinthia"
 CTH_idea_6_desc: "The 'Carinthia' was first published in 1811 and is the oldest magazine in Austria. The permission for the publication of a journal was applied for by a 'Society of Friends of the Fatherland'. The original, self-proposed task of the 'Carinthia' was to present the historical, ethnological, topographical, picturesque, industrial and agronomic importance of Carinthia."
 CTH_idea_7: "Carinthian Slovenes"
 CTH_idea_7_desc: "In the High Middle Ages, German and Slavic noble families existed in parallel in Carantania, whereby the German nobility finally prevailed. The direct displacement of Slavs occurred only sporadically in the sparsely populated areas. As a result, a language border developed which remained stable until the 19th century. During this period, German had a dominant social or linguistic sociological role in Klagenfurt, while the immediate surroundings remained Slovenian. With the emergence of the national movement in the late monarchy, assimilation was accelerated and at the same time the conflict between the ethnic groups intensified."

 PHE_idea_3_desc: "As more and more Pechenegs converted to Islam in the 11th century, a disastrous civil war broke out between the Muslim minority among the Pechenegs and the still pagan majority in which the Muslims won. We must pay a certain amount of tolerance to the different religions that our subjects belong to."
 PHE_idea_4: "Murderer of the Grand Duke Sviatoslav"

 CIE_idea_6: "Development of Cieszyn"
 CIE_idea_6_desc: "Cieszyn became wealthy very quickly while under Habsburg rule. In 1774 the 'Imperial road' was built between Vienna and Lemberg, running through Cieszyn.

 KUJ_idea_5: "Kujavian Coastline?"
 KUJ_idea_5_desc: "The Teutonic state founded up north kills and forcibly converts Slavs and Balts to Christianity. However, if they become too powerful, we would be in danger. We can't let that happen; expanding into the Pomerelian coastline wouldn't be a bad idea, to protect our Slavic brethren against the Teutonic Knights. Since the Balts aren't Christian, it would be good to accept their religion to gain their trust."
 KUJ_idea_6: "Between Two Rivers"
 KUJ_idea_6_desc: "Our duchy is situated along the Wisla river, however on our eastern frontier flows the Notec, which provides us with a gateway to trading with HRE states. In 1774, there was even a canal built in Bydgoszcz connecting the two rivers."
 KUJ_idea_7: "Legacy of Copernicus"
 KUJ_idea_7_desc: "Copernicus left behind a legacy of being a true Renaissance man. Copernicus directed the defense of Olsztyn and Warmia during the Thirteen Years' War.

 OPO_idea_2: "Relocation of Opole Castle"
 OPO_idea_2_desc: "In the early 13th century, Duke Casimir I of Opole decided to move the settlement from Pasieka Island onto the right bank of the Oder river. All of the inhabitants had to be moved in order to make place for the castle that was eventually built in the place of the old city, attracting many merchants, particularly from the HRE."
 OPO_idea_3: "Crumbled Piast Realm"
 OPO_idea_3_desc: "As the Silesian duchies crumble and crumble, it wouldn't do any harm to get ourselves some vassals. We hold a legitimate claim not only to the entire Silesian land, but to the whole former Polish kingdom. The key is to use this opportunity fast before any of our cousins manage to do so."
 OPO_idea_4: "Satellite Towns"
 OPO_idea_4_desc: "The duchies of Cieszyn, Oswiecim, Ratibor and Opava are essentially satellite towns to us; the many bridges in these lands and our friendly relations with them allow us to march with our army to faraway lands and supply will be more widely available."
 OPO_idea_5: "A Confluence of Cultures"
 OPO_idea_5_desc: "Upper Silesia is a confluence of many cultures. The Silesians are being constantly greeted with Polish, Bohemian and especially German settlers. The Duchy of Opole is given the challenge to sustain all these different nationalities to live on one street in peace and prosperity."
 OPO_idea_6: "Kehr ich einst zur Heimat wieder..."
 OPO_idea_6_desc: "As the old German Silesian song goes, 'One day I will return home'. The Silesians eagerly are conscripted into the army and fight for their Prince, who they hope one day will become a King."

Later, during the Thirty Years War it was essentially a fortress which was besieged and conquered by Prussian, French, Russian, Swedish and Austrian armies. Having larger garrisons should secure our safety. In 1109 it was successfully defended from the attack of Heinrich V, so we need to go back to the way we used to organize our defenses."
 GLG_idea_2: "Dadosesani Legacy"
 GLG_idea_2_desc: "The Dadosesani, who were a sub-group of Silesians, founded Glogów and we, the Duchy of Glogów, are their successors. Little is known about them, but we know one thing: they were a powerful tribe and our neighbours envy us for our ancestors."
 GLG_idea_3: "Grunberg"
 GLG_idea_3_desc: "Grunberg (Zielona Góra) was founded by settlers from western German states and Flanders. The city grew rapidly and it was the 2nd largest city in our duchy. It was also the wealthiest, providing an influx of Western ideas into our duchy."
 GLG_idea_4: "Testament of Premislaus"
 GLG_idea_4_desc: "Premislaus II left his duchy of Wielkopolska to us after his death in 1304. However, due to our weakness, we couldn't push that claim. We can strike at Wielkopolska, but we need to find a good time to do so."
 GLG_idea_5: "Kasper Elyan"

 GLG_idea_6: "Grunberg Fires"
 GLG_idea_6_desc: "The large, overcrowded Grunberg had many fires. The first recorded fire was in 1456, and the largest one was in 1582. Then followed other major fires in 1608, 1627, 1631, 1651, 1689, 1735, 1793 and 5 more after that. We need better building methods and a more advanced system of dealing with fires."

 OSW_idea_2: "Proximity to Kraków"
 OSW_idea_2_desc: "Our close proximity to the largest city in the Piast lands allows us to learn great ideas from the 'Paris of the East'. Our army also knows that they are not only guarding our duchy, but also a pathway to a very important city in the region."
 OSW_idea_3: "Fertile Lands of Zator"
 OSW_idea_3_desc: "The fertile lands of the town of Zator, along with the surrounding lands of our duchy are great for farming and produce excellent crops. Our people will never be hungry with the land quality that we have. During war, we will have a good supply of food to stop our people worrying about starvation."
 OSW_idea_4: "Defence of Oswiecim"
 OSW_idea_4_desc: "During the so-called Deluge in 1659, Oswiecim was heavily destroyed by the attacking Swedish army. We should try to improve our defences to avoid our town from being destroyed again."
 OSW_idea_5: "Lesser Poland Ambition"

 OSW_idea_6_desc: "Throughout the 1700s and especially the 1800s, many migrants from the area of Myslenice and other parts of Galicia have settled in our town. Most settled in the countryside and became farmers, though some settled in cities as they were tradesmen."
 OSW_idea_7: "Great Fire of 1863"

 RCB_idea_2: "Cultural Center"
 RCB_idea_2_desc: "Our capital is of vital importance to the Silesian culture. It was here that the music for 'Gaude Mater Polonia' was written, the unofficial anthem of our duchy and later the Kingdom of Poland. Our steadily developing duchy has many skillful advisors who compete with each other to join our small, but powerful court."
 RCB_idea_3: "Racibórz Markets"
 RCB_idea_3_desc: "The Racibórz markets which started in the 1300s made our duchy very rich and we now have much influence over trade in our region. These markets were the largest in Silesia and goods traded included salt and wheat. Our industry flourished because of this."
 RCB_idea_4: "Hanusz Privileges"
 RCB_idea_4_desc: "The Hanusz privileges were awarded to our duchy in 1531. These privileges protected serfs in our duchy from the growing power of the nobility. Our serfs feel safe in our duchy and are willing to work harder for their duke."
 RCB_idea_5: "Devout Catholics"
 RCB_idea_5_desc: "During the age of Reformation and after, Racibórz was a very Catholic city. Even though the number of Germans in Silesia grew, Racibórz welcomed King Jan Sobieski on his way to Vienna very humbly as they viewed him as a protector of the faith."
 RCB_idea_6: "Germans and Development"
 RCB_idea_6_desc: "As Racibórz was in the Kingdom of Prussia, it experienced huge economic growth; in particular its metal industry benefited. By the 1800s, the population of the city reached 35,000."
 RCB_idea_7: "Berlin-Vienna Railway Expansion"

 LNN_idea_3: "Calvinists and Catholics"
 LNN_idea_3_desc: "As the Thirty Years' War sparked off, Legnica remained neutral. Duke Jerzy Rudolf declared full isolation from the war and denied military access to both Catholic and Protestant sides. However, under large pressure, in 1634 there was a battle within the Duchy between the Swedish and Habsburg armies."
 LNN_idea_4: "Development Before War"
 LNN_idea_4_desc: "Legnica always preferred to be rich rather than just powerful. An example of its flourishing economy is that there were many houses outside of the city walls. However, when war came, the people that lived outside the city walls were often hired as mercenaries by the duke."
 LNN_idea_5: "The Knight Academy"
 LNN_idea_5_desc: "In 1708 a state-run Knight School was opened in Legnica. It was open to members of all religions, however restricted only for the nobility of course. It was attended for three years, where scholars studied Law, Literature, Philosophy, History, Geography, Politics and other genres of education."
 LNN_idea_6: "Urbanization"
 LNN_idea_6_desc: "With the inclusion of Legnica into Prussia, it became the capital of the Regierungsbezirk Niederschlesien. Silesia had much autonomy and as German settlers arrived, so did pressure to build more housing. Legnica started to expand its mining industry and farming in the countryside."
 LNN_idea_7: "The Strain of Survival"
 LNN_idea_7_desc: "We cannot let our neighbours bully our duchy. We need to expand our diplomacy in order to secure relations with some powerful states. In 1806 Legnica wanted to surrender to Russian forces, but nobody was brave enough to inform them about their surrender."

 ALE_idea_3_desc: "The first Count of Alençon was William 'Talvad' de Bellême, a violent and impious man who was said to have cursed infant William the Conqueror in his crib. Supposedly Talvas was a soothsayer who knew the house of Normandie would cause the downfall of House Bellême."
 ALE_idea_4: "Claim the Ducal Title"

 BAR_idea_1_desc: "From the ancient Frankish 'pagus' of Scarponensis came a noble dynasty that ended up inheriting various titles in the former Lotharingian heartland, including the Counties of Barrois, Pfirt, and Montbéliard. Its origins stretch far back into Gallo-Roman legend."
 BAR_idea_2: "Barrois Mouvant"
 BAR_idea_2_desc: "Barrois is unique for being split between the overlordship of the King of France and the Holy Roman Empire, holding lands on both sides of the border. We are adept at balancing our diplomacy between these two powers to secure de-facto independence from both."
 BAR_idea_3: "Crusader Counts"

 JYA_idea_2: "Hasan the Great"
 JYA_idea_2_desc: "The founder of the Jalayirid state in Iraq was Shaikh Hasan 'Burzug', meaning 'the Great'. When the Ilkhanate was weakening in the fourteenth century, Hasan saw an opportunity and propped up a puppet ruler, holding the real reins of the state."
 JYA_idea_3: "Numismatics"
 JYA_idea_3_desc: "Unlike minor neighboring principalities, the Jalayirid Sultanate was able to issue its own gold coinage, stamped with Kufic script containing holy phrases as was traditional for most Islamic powers at the time."
 JYA_idea_4: "Royal Blood"
 JYA_idea_4_desc: "The royal line of the Jalayirids descends maternally from a daughter of Arghun, the fourth Khan of the Ilkhanate, and thus from the Borjigin clan of Genghis Khan himself."
 JYA_idea_5: "Mongol Chancellery"
 JYA_idea_5_desc: "The Jalayirid state not only descends from the Ilkhanate by bloodlines, but by governmental practices too. Royal documents were issued simultaneously in Persian and Mongolian, and diplomatic missals were sealed with Arabic calligraphy in red ink - both conventions inherited from the Ilkhan court."
 JYA_idea_6: "Dynamic Court"
 JYA_idea_6_desc: "While some states find themselves anchored to a particular city, the Jalayirid Sultanate variously had its capital at Baghdad, Tabriz, Soltaniyeh, and Basra, sometimes with multiple rulers reigning simultaneously in different regions. This lent the Sultanate a dynamism that let it withstand outside pressures."
 JYA_idea_7: "Mesopotamia"
 JYA_idea_7_desc: "The cradle of Jalayirid power was the Fertile Crescent between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, a land aptly called by the Greeks 'Mesopotamia', literally 'between rivers'.

 CRT_idea_2: "Linear A & B"
 CRT_idea_2_desc: "The oldest samples of Greek writing in existence are Cretan fragments in scripts dubbed 'Linear A' and 'Linear B'. The wisest scholars of our lands should come together to try to decipher them."
 CRT_idea_3: "Duchy of Candia"
 CRT_idea_3_desc: "In the wake of the Fourth Crusade, Venice was sold the overlordship of Crete by the King of Thessalonica. Rather than attempting to directly subjugate Crete to the Serenissima, Venice established a titular Duchy or Kingdom on the island, usually under the governance of the Morosini family."
 CRT_idea_4: "Cretan School"
 CRT_idea_4_desc: "Crete was a center of Renaissance scholarship during its Venetian period, with texts from as far away as Prussia making their way to the island. One of the gems of this Cretan Renaissance tradition was the development of the 'Cretan School' of painting, headed by El Greco, which united Byzantine and Italian styles."
 CRT_idea_5: "The Longest Siege"
 CRT_idea_5_desc: "The Siege of Venetian Candia by an Ottoman fleet from 1648-1669 stood as the longest siege in history when the Ottomans finally were able to overrun the city. It is a testament to the utter bravery and perseverance of the Cretan people."
 CRT_idea_6: "Bektashis"

This sophisticated state incorporated many cultures and practices - we should follow in their footsteps!"
 AVR_idea_2: "Sarir"
 AVR_idea_2_desc: "A mysterious Christian state in the remote mountains of Dagestan, Sarir is said to have been founded by a Sassanid general who settled in the area after being sent to rein in the Caucasus."
 AVR_idea_3: "Mongol Tribute"

 AVR_idea_4: "Avar Lingua Franca"
 AVR_idea_4_desc: "The Avar language is privileged above other tongues of the region due to its status as a literary language and its use as a lingua franca to facilitate communication between different ethnic groups."
 AVR_idea_5: "Lekianoba"
 AVR_idea_5_desc: "The Avars of Dagestan did not abandon the raiding practices of their ancient Turkic predecessors, and turned their fury upon the Georgians settled south of the Caucasian range. These raids were called Lekianoba and were immortalized in Avar epic poetry."
 AVR_idea_6: "Srazhenie s Nadir Shakhom"
 AVR_idea_6_desc: "Of all the Avar epic poems, the most memorable is 'Srazhenie s Nadir Shakhom', which recounts the story of how Nadir Shah of Persia tried to subjugate the people of Dagestan and ended up with his 100,000 man army being routed by the Avar Khan."
 AVR_idea_7: "Caucasian Imamate"
 AVR_idea_7_desc: "When the imperialist Russians sought to bring Dagestan under their control and impose a false religion on the Avar people, local Imams banded together to form a state that could resist them. The Imamate held off the far-superior Russian army for over thirty years."

 LEB_idea_2: "Crusader Baronies"
 LEB_idea_2_desc: "During the Crusades, the entire Lebanese coast was conquered by the Crusading armies and re-organized into baronies like the Lordship of Beirut and the Lordship of Sidon. Beirut ended up being one of the most long-lived of all Crusader states and a center of royal Jerusalemite power."
 LEB_idea_3: "Ma'anids"
 LEB_idea_3_desc: "The first reigning dynasty of the Mount Lebanon Emirate under Ottoman suzerainty was the Banu Ma'an family, which originated in southern Arabia. As proud Druzes, they stood apart from the surrounding Muslim states, and under the great leader Fakhr-al-Din II, conquered the entire northern coast of the Levant."
 LEB_idea_4: "Druze-Maronite Symbiosis"
 LEB_idea_4_desc: "Lebanon is home to many significant religious groups living in harmony. There are Sunnis, Shi'ites, Druzes, and Maronites, an Eastern Catholic branch which may have been descended from Monothelitism. The Druze and Maronite populations came to rely on each other despite attempts by hostile foreign powers to sow discord between them."
 LEB_idea_5: "Legacy of Ain Dara"
 LEB_idea_5_desc: "At the Battle of Ain Dara, the Shihab dynasty defeated a coalition of rivals and established themselves as unquestioned leaders of Lebanon. Though this infighting was unfortunate, we can learn from the tactical lessons of the battle."
 LEB_idea_6: "Mutasarrifate"
 LEB_idea_6_desc: "When the Mount Lebanon Emirate was deprecated, the Ottomans did not simply abolish Lebanese autonomy but turned the region into a 'Mutasarrifate' under a special type of governor directly appointed by the Sublime Porte."

 SCA_idea_2: "Cultural Fountain"

 SCA_idea_3: "Sjælland"
 SCA_idea_3_desc: "The island archipelago of Sjælland creates an interesting defensive barrier and trade choke point allowing for Scandinavian dominance of the Baltic Sea. From the days of Rorik Ringslinger, Norse states have held their courts upon these islands."
 SCA_idea_4: "State Churches"
 SCA_idea_4_desc: "While it took centuries for Scandinavia to adopt Christianity, it was one of the first regions to rapidly convert to Lutheranism and institute state churches independent of Rome. This Protestant ethos ran deep in Scandinavian thought and culture."
 SCA_idea_5: "Shared Language"
 SCA_idea_5_desc: "The dialects of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden fall on a mutually-intelligible continuum, meaning citizens from each nation can generally understand each other despite their linguistic differences."
 SCA_idea_6: "Northern Neighbors"
 SCA_idea_6_desc: "Though the primary cultural zones of Scandinavia are traditionally thought of as Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, the peninsula is in fact shared with many Finnic peoples, including the Sapmi, who once occupied the whole of its northern fjords and forests. Reindeer play a large role in Sapmi society, being used for transportation, food, clothing, religious ceremonies, and more."

 ARB_idea_1_desc: "Tragically, after the death of Prophet Muhammad, debates over succession broke out almost immediately. The era of the 'Rashidun' or 'Rightly-Guided' Caliphs gave way to a brutal civil war called the First Fitna, which left many Sayyids dead in its aftermath. The Ummah was turned against itself, and almost collapsed in the chaos. However, the Umayyads and then Abbasids emerged stronger than ever, each having learned from the mistakes of their predecessors."
 ARB_idea_2: "Jizya"
 ARB_idea_2_desc: "The strength of the Jizya tax is twofold. Not only does it bring in great amounts of money to the Caliph, but it also encourages natural conversion to the true faith by families who wish to avoid it. Though their conversion may not be genuine, over generations their faith solidifies."
 ARB_idea_3: "Caliphal Court Culture"
 ARB_idea_3_desc: "The early Caliphs borrowed much of their court culture from that of Imperial Persia, and thus maintained a sophisticated palace environment which attracted the most talented scientists, artists, and men-of-letters. Though sometimes criticized as decadent, the Caliphs amassed incredible prestige due to their lavish milieus."
 ARB_idea_4: "Arabia Felix"
 ARB_idea_4_desc: "The Romans called our homeland 'Lucky Arabia', and our abundance of rare and lucrative trade goods certainly upholds this label. Spices, peppers, dates, pearls, incense, coffee, exotic teas and dyes from India and the Malays... many Arabs have grown rich by facilitating trade between East and West."
 ARB_idea_5: "United Ummah"
 ARB_idea_5_desc: "Our faith community is united under a single banner, just as in the earliest days of the Prophet (sallâ Allâhu 'alayhi wa-'ala âli-hi wa-sallam). There can be no greater fate for the Ummah than this unity of force and purpose."
 ARB_idea_6: "Rub al-Khali Caravans"
 ARB_idea_6_desc: "Dominating the Arabian Peninsula is the Arabian Desert, a vast and inhospitable wasteland with oases few and far between. Despite its dangers, Arab traders and tribesmen have crossed its sun-scorched dunes since time immemorial in camel caravans, protected from the brutal heat by traditional clothing."
 ARB_idea_7: "Diglossia"
 ARB_idea_7_desc: "The 'Classical Arabic' of the Holy Qur'an is said to be uncreated and co-eternal with God, and is used for literary and governmental functions. However, the various lands under control of the Arabian Caliphate speak their own local dialects of Arabic in day-to-day life as well. Thus the average educated Arab is familiar with two diglossic variants of their native language."

 GAZ_idea_2: "Multi-Ethnic State"

 GAZ_idea_3: "Adopt the Title of Shamkhal"
 GAZ_idea_3_desc: "In the fifteenth century, Ali-Beg founded a new dynasty and adopted the Turkic title of 'Shamkhal', leading to the state often being referred to by later historians as a 'Shamkhalate'."
 GAZ_idea_4: "Juma Mosque"
 GAZ_idea_4_desc: "The presence of Islam in Dagestan was tenuous for many centuries, but in 778 an Arab governor built a grand mosque in Juma on behalf of the Caliphate which stands to the present day, denoted by an inscription dedicating the mosque to 'Almighty Allah'."
 GAZ_idea_5: "Raiding Parties"
 GAZ_idea_5_desc: "The Shamkhalate was said to be able to raise 100,000 armed men including both footsoldiers and cavalry. In times of peace, troops would often enter into Georgia and Circassia to raid the infidels and expand the state's influence around the Caucasia region."
 GAZ_idea_6: "Fickle Diplomacy"
 GAZ_idea_6_desc: "The Shamkhalate survived by playing its enemies against each other and constantly switching alliances between major powers. At times we cooperated with Russia, at times Persia, and at times the Ottomans, always ready to defect to the more useful ally."
 GAZ_idea_7: "Resist Gulistan"
 GAZ_idea_7_desc: "Russia began to pry into Shamkhal affairs with the construction of Sunzha fortress in 1566. With the treaty of Gulistan over two centuries later Russia annexed the Shamkhalates to its empire. We must resist the Russians at all costs and make sure such a treaty is never enforced."

Our help to Baibars arguably was the biggest factor that made him victorious in his war against the Mongols, so our skills in combat are known well by various other states."
 RAM_idea_3: "Mamluk Recognition"
 RAM_idea_3_desc: "These lands are given to us by the Mamluks, the strongest nation in the region, because we helped them in their war against Armenians. So while a regional power gave us these lands, no one can say that we don't fit to rule these lands."
 RAM_idea_4: "Relations With Beyliks"
 RAM_idea_4_desc: "We usually don't upset other beyliks, because while there are other threats that may end us, we don't want to create another enemy. So being friends with our fellow beyliks instead of enemies should really help."
 RAM_idea_5: "Changing Policies"
 RAM_idea_5_desc: "Every nation desires what is best for itself, so do we. We can't see the future, and what it will bring to us. Someday we may want to be protected, someday we may want to be liberated. And when there are so many beyliks to interact with and Egyptians from the south, it's best to keep in touch with most of the nations around us."
 RAM_idea_6: "Halil Bey's Legacy"
 RAM_idea_6_desc: "Sometimes a book is sharper than a sword. Halil Bey knew that very well and tried to enlighten our country by encouraging the scholars to do poetry and research about the world and Islam. We must follow his steps and make sure that Ramazan is a safe haven for scholars."
 RAM_idea_7: "Ramazanid Construction"

 DUL_idea_2: "Smashing From Inside"
 DUL_idea_2_desc: "Fighting is not always for some nations' interests, it is sometimes for someone's desire. A lot of people want to govern our enemies' cities and to be crowned as a bey or even a sultan. Maybe supporting them against our enemies will make us benefit."
 DUL_idea_3: "Leadership In Wars"
 DUL_idea_3_desc: "A lot of nations have interests in our lands and most of them are regional powers. However most of our leaders, like Karaca Bey, always found a way to push our enemies from our land. No one can deny that our beys and generals are skilled ones."
 DUL_idea_4: "Turkification"
 DUL_idea_4_desc: "The land we are living in used to belong to another culture and because of it there are so many people from other cultures in our lands. However this needs to change. Anatolia is now a Turkish land and we will make sure that Turks are the majority in our lands."
 DUL_idea_5: "Using the Highlands"

 DUL_idea_7: "Balance Policy"
 DUL_idea_7_desc: "Even though we are ready to defend our nation by any means necessary, an attack from a regional power would cost many of our own lives. So before declaring war on someone and taking sides, we can try embracing a balance policy and make ourselves loved by everyone."

We gained their trust, and when Timurbas, a governor of Anatolia, was afraid of Mongols kidnapping and killing him he appointed us as his regent. But we refused to be just a regent and took over Eastern Anatolia. So by claiming that we are technically the governor of Anatolia, the fabrication of claims will be much easier for us."

 ERE_idea_2_desc: "When our governor ran away and left these lands, Mongols wanted us to submit to their rule. But we refused and when they tried to invade us, we defeated them and pushed them from our lands. This victory surely will make other states respect us."
 ERE_idea_3: "Victory of Gerenbük"
 ERE_idea_3_desc: "Even though we took our lands rightfully, we still had some enemies. Timurbas's son claimed that he was the governor of Anatolia and tried to take over our lands. However we defeated them and showed who is the rightful ruler of these lands. Eretna Bey claimed himself 'Ala ad-Din' after this battle and became the undisputed ruler of Eretna."
 ERE_idea_4: "Support of The People"
 ERE_idea_4_desc: "The Mongols treated the people of Anatolia really harshly and made them suffer, so they wanted new leadership. If we treat our people kinder than they did we can show what good leadership is and prevent any possible rebellions from threatening our future."
 ERE_idea_5: "Power of Governors"
 ERE_idea_5_desc: "Our nation started with quite a big land, and governing this may cause some trouble to us. Even though we don't want to admit it, we must govern our nation by giving governors more power and let them govern our cities."
 ERE_idea_6: "A Religious Beylik"
 ERE_idea_6_desc: "Religion is so important for our state. We celebrate with praising and we become more powerful with our sheiks. Considering these lands once belonged to infidels, it is time to show our people what is the true faith and how to live according to Islam."
 ERE_idea_7: "Mountains of the East"
 ERE_idea_7_desc: "Anatolia, especially the eastern part, is a region of mountains. This land shape benefits the defender in a battle. So if we build our castles in these strategic areas, we can make our nation inaccessible for our foes."

 GRM_idea_2: "Landlocked"
 GRM_idea_2_desc: "We are surrounded by new beyliks, founded by our own former commanders, denying us access to the coast or Byzantine territory. In order not to fall under the pressure of our neighbours, we must be able to rely all the more on troops capable of defending ourselves."
 GRM_idea_3: "Protector of the Turks"
 GRM_idea_3_desc: "Our western neighbours, the beyliks of Mentese, Aydin, Ladik, Saruhan and Karesi, were in their early days subjects of us, while the southern beyliks of the Sâhib Ata and the Hamids relied on our protection against Karaman. The founder of Candar was also one of our commanders. We are indeed guardians of the Turks!"
 GRM_idea_4: "Excellent Coinage"
 GRM_idea_4_desc: "Germiyan was the beylik who minted the first and highest quality coins, which is why our coins are now used as valid currency not only within our borders. Our neighbours envy our minters and our coinage."
 GRM_idea_5: "First Turks in Anatolia"
 GRM_idea_5_desc: "Germiyan played an important role in the settlement of the Aegean coast by Turks. We were the first to spread the Islamic faith and the Turkish culture, which eventually displaced the native Greeks."
 GRM_idea_6: "Patron of Literature"
 GRM_idea_6_desc: "Some important Turkish poets came from Germiyan, among them Seyhi. After his studies in Persia, he became the best-known author of his time and wrote an everlasting satirical masterpiece of literary history, his 'Donkey Book'."
 GRM_idea_7: "Alliance with Timur"
 GRM_idea_7_desc: "To regain the territories lost to the Ottomans, Bey Yakup II allied with the Timurids. The Ottomans were defeated in the Battle of Ankara in 1402 so that Germiyan was given their former territories as a reward for our performance in the battle by Timur."

 GNJ_idea_2_desc: "Ganja is a major agricultural region in Azerbaijan, and in order to produce the food necessary to sustain the population, its farmers must be careful about controlling weeds and other pests that may ruin their crop yields."
 GNJ_idea_3: "Kush Trade"
 GNJ_idea_3_desc: "The Hindu Kush, a mountain range separating Afghanistan and India, is a significant passing point for Silk Road trade, which in turn reaches Ganja. We should promote our traders' rights in this foreign land to ensure the spices and luxury goods continue to flow west and earn us tax returns."
 GNJ_idea_4: "Pottery"
 GNJ_idea_4_desc: "Many different ethnic groups live in Ganja, including Azeris, Persians, Turks, Kurds, Russians, and Armenians. They all bring their own artistic traditions to bear, including silk weaving and ceramic painting. Pots and pans of all types can be found throughout Ganja."

 GNJ_idea_6: "Snooping Dogs"
 GNJ_idea_6_desc: "Ganja was closely aligned with the Safavid Empire in Persia and its successors, eventually becoming an independent Khanate when the Empire disintegrated. Its autonomous Khans needed to maintain order in the region while the rest of Iran was in chaos, whether through military police or bloodhounds."
 GNJ_idea_7: "Dank Environs"
 GNJ_idea_7_desc: "Ganja is located in the Kur-Araz lowlands in the foothills of the Caucasus mountains. Though it is semi-arid, it still rains at points throughout the year and temperatures can plunge far below freezing in the winter."

 TBR_idea_2: "Commercial Hub"
 TBR_idea_2_desc: "Tabriz is one of the most influential trading cities in the Middle East which is not only due to our favorable location on the Silk Road but also to our hard-working people. According to Marco Polo, Tabriz maintained close trade relations even with states in Italy."
 TBR_idea_3: "Capital of Nations"

 TBR_idea_5_desc: "The Arg of Tabriz was built in the 14th century during the Ilkhanate era and is a landmark of the city thanks to its exceptional construction. The point of pride for the building is that its vaulted ayvan is larger than the famous historic vault of Chosroes or the Taq Kisra at Ctesiphon. It contains, among other things, a gigantic mosque, prayer halls, libraries, a mausoleum and a courtyard with a pool."
 TBR_idea_6: "Vibrant Bazars"
 TBR_idea_6_desc: "The bazaar of Tabriz, allegedly founded in the 8th century, is today one of the largest covered bazaars in the world. Not only are all kinds of exotic goods traded here, but it is also a center of the social, religious and educational life of the city."

 IRQ_idea_3: "Crucible of Cultures"
 IRQ_idea_3_desc: "Our realm is home to various cultures and religions, including Arabs, Kurds, Turks, Armenians and Persians. If we want to prevent the rise of nationalist tendencies among minorities, we must regard these people as full citizens and allow them their freedoms."
 IRQ_idea_4: "Sumerian Legacy"
 IRQ_idea_4_desc: "Iraq was inhabited by the Sumerians in the 3rd millennium B.C., the world's first civilization, thanks to their inventions of scripture, bureaucracy and irrigation systems. They have perished a long time ago, but we should revive their minds."
 IRQ_idea_5: "Defence Barriers Against Persia"

 IRQ_idea_6: "Islamic Golden Age"

 IRQ_idea_7: "A Toy of the Powers"
 IRQ_idea_7_desc: "Iraq has been part of other realms for a long time, including the Abbasid, Mongolian, Persian, Ottoman and Mamluk Empires, under which our people and country have suffered. We must prevent this from happening again and preserve our independence by forming strong alliances."

 KLM_idea_1: "Master of Livestock Breeding"
 KLM_idea_1_desc: "Our homeland is only sparsely suitable for agriculture, which is why we have to make a living from fishing and cattle breeding. In the course of time, we bred camels, horses, sheep, goats and cattle. The Kalmyk cattle is perfectly suited to the living conditions in the steppe."
 KLM_idea_2: "Buddhists of Europe"
 KLM_idea_2_desc: "Originally we followed our own pagan faith, but in the early 17th century we adopted Vajrayana Buddhism as the predominant religion. Since we migrated westwards, we have become the only Buddhist people in Europe."
 KLM_idea_3: "Masters of the Tatars"
 KLM_idea_3_desc: "Thanks to our Mongolian past we were able to challenge the local Tatars and wage several wars against them. We successfully suppressed the Nogai and could force the Crimean Tatars to pay tribute."
 KLM_idea_4: "Fluctuating Alliances"
 KLM_idea_4_desc: "Several times we formed and broke nominal alliances with neighbouring nations that might have become dangerous for us, securing our survival for centuries. We are masters of illusion."
 KLM_idea_5: "Protector of the Russian Southern Border"

 KLM_idea_6: "Superior Cavalry"
 KLM_idea_6_desc: "To obtain support against Muslim forces in the South, the Russian Empire requested the recruitment of Kalmyk cavalry for its own armies. This is truly a proof of the abilities of our cavalrymen."

 GOL_idea_1: "Heir to the Golden Horde"
 GOL_idea_1_desc: "The Golden Horde was one of the successor states to Genghis Khan's empire. We were ruling a big chunk of land and we were unstoppable. However, after many years our power declined and we have become a weak state. But now it's time to claim what is rightfully ours and we won't be afraid of battling our foes by doing so. To arms!"
 GOL_idea_2: "Our Ancestors' Religions"
 GOL_idea_2_desc: "Even if we believe in Islam now, our ancestors had different beliefs such as Tengrism or Buddhism. We can't throw our culture away, else can we really call ourselves a state? We must tolerate our former religions if we really want to call ourselves a nation with history."
 GOL_idea_3: "Kipchak Cavalry"
 GOL_idea_3_desc: "The Kipchaks are an important part of our nation, and they sure know how to ride a horse because of their culture. In a state of war, we can make them fight for us and recruit with less money."
 GOL_idea_4: "Great Stand of Ugra"
 GOL_idea_4_desc: "Russian lands were always a sweet target for us, and we were able to control these lands for a while, even though we don't want to accept that we are not in a golden age. So in 1480, we chose to leave the Russians alone instead of fighting. The Russians knew that if we tried to defeat them, we could. So our mercy to them will benefit us on the diplomatic stage."
 GOL_idea_5: "Dealing With Rebellions"
 GOL_idea_5_desc: "There are already many states that broke free from us. There are still some people who want to separate our nation. We tried respect, but now we must find another solution. Perhaps if we use our ancestors' tactics with dealing with the rebels they will learn."
 GOL_idea_6: "A Sedentary Horde"
 GOL_idea_6_desc: "A lot of nations around us think that we are some barbaric state which just raids nations. But it is not true. We adopted a sedentary culture and founded our own cities, such as Sarai. We know how to found and improve a city and we couldn't need that knowledge more right now as we don't have much land."
 GOL_idea_7: "Tributary System"
 GOL_idea_7_desc: "We don't always want to conquer, instead we may need money for our nation. So our ancestors found a great way to gain some money for our nation: they made other nations pay for us. That way we became prosperous. We can adopt their system and try to force our vassals to give more money to us."

 VGB_idea_2: "Trading Empire on the Volga"
 VGB_idea_2_desc: "Not only through the foundation of cities and caravansaries we have become a true trading empire, but also through our favorable location on the Volga River. Today we are an important bridge for long-distance trade between Russian and Oriental merchants."
 VGB_idea_3: "City Founders"
 VGB_idea_3_desc: "With the help of oriental architects and lush trading incomes, we are able to found new cities and rebuild and expand existing ones. Among them, there are Bolgar, Bilär, Suwar, Kashan, Juketau, Oshel, Tukhchin, Bryakhimov and Taw Ile, all featuring fortresses, mosques and caravansaries."
 VGB_idea_4: "Dissolution of Tribal Ties"
 VGB_idea_4_desc: "Our state is rather an alliance of different tribes, which have their own sphere of power and rulers and sometimes act against our ruler. We must begin to reduce their autonomy and centralize our state."
 VGB_idea_5: "Descent from the Huns"
 VGB_idea_5_desc: "Our Kings do not only descend from the Great Bulgarian Dulo Dynasty, but also from the legendary Attila the Hun. After he had his brother Bleda murdered, he conquered Carpathia and threatened the Roman Empire with harsh military campaigns. His martial skills should be an example to us."
 VGB_idea_6: "Restoration of the Bulgarian Empire"
 VGB_idea_6_desc: "Until the 7th century, a large part of the landmass north of the Black Sea was part of the Great Bulgarian Empire. Our first Khan Kotrag was the second eldest son of the last Great Bulgarian ruler, which is why we can declare ourselves heirs of the Great Bulgarians."
 VGB_idea_7: "Create Our Own Identity"
 VGB_idea_7_desc: "It is uncertain whether a Volga Bulgarian culture exists at all, as we have been influenced over time by Turkish, Russian and Finnish peoples. Therefore, we must finally begin to create our own national identity!"

 NEG_idea_2: "Anglo-Saxon Exile State"
 NEG_idea_2_desc: "We can call ourselves the last true Anglo-Saxons. While the Norman conquerors are displacing and replacing Anglo-Saxon culture, we are the keepers of Anglo-Saxon tradition and customs."
 NEG_idea_3: "English Varangians"
 NEG_idea_3_desc: "During our escape from England we arrived in Constantinople, where we helped Emperor Alexios I Komnenos to defend the city against an infidel army. Surprised by our fighting abilities, the Emperor took some of our companions into his private army, where they certainly made a name for our people."
 NEG_idea_4: "Scourge of the Infidels"

 NEG_idea_5: "Edwardsaga"
 NEG_idea_5_desc: "Edwardsaga, written in Iceland in the 14th century, covers mainly the life of our former King Edward the Confessor, using English and French sources. This work is considered the most important testimony for our nation."
 NEG_idea_6: "Anglo-Saxon Odyssey"
 NEG_idea_6_desc: "The origins of our nation are very similar to those of the Trojans who sought a new home after the Achaeans conquered their homeland. Led by their prince Aeneas and after long journeys, they found a new home on the Italian coast, where the descendants of Aeneas would later found Rome. As is well known, one of the greatest Empires of all times emerged from Rome, so we could possibly become the founders of a new Empire as well..."
 NEG_idea_7: "Reclaiming the Homeland"

 APP_idea_1: "Qarmatian Sympathisers"
 APP_idea_1_desc: "During the Mirdasid period, Aleppo evolved into a center of the Qarmatians, who rejected the wealth of urban Sunnis, which is why they are considered as infidels by them. If we take a middle course, we will keep both confessions happy."
 APP_idea_2: "Under Fatimid and Byzantine Pressure"
 APP_idea_2_desc: "Our nation is threatened in the north by the Byzantine Empire, which is reclaiming the ancient borders of the Roman Empire, and in the south by the Fatimids, who are claiming the entire Muslim territory. We must not become their subjects!"
 APP_idea_3: "Development instead of Autonomy"
 APP_idea_3_desc: "Aleppo prospered under the Mirdasids, who did not aim for their independence from their lords, but instead focused on the expansion of cities. We should follow their example."
 APP_idea_4: "Resistance against the Crusaders"
 APP_idea_4_desc: "Aleppo was besieged twice by the crusaders, but they never managed to break through our city walls. This turned our capital into a stronghold from which numerous actions against the Crusaders were planned. Our most significant success was the conquest of Edessa under Imad ad-Din Zengi, which ushered in the end of Christian rule in the Levant."
 APP_idea_5: "Christian Viziers"
 APP_idea_5_desc: "By being relatively tolerant to Christians, we will be much more likely to discover extraordinary talents which we can potentially employ at our court. By even appointing some of them as viziers, we will create a kind of competition in which Christians compete against each other."
 APP_idea_6: "Home of Poets and Philosophers"
 APP_idea_6_desc: "Aleppo is home to some great personalities such as the poet al-Mutanabbi or the philosopher al-Farabi. We should make sure that such men will continue to live in our nation in the future by promoting these arts."
 APP_idea_7: "Recruitment of Turkish Mercenaries"
 APP_idea_7_desc: "The light cavalry of the Turks has proven itself as superior compared to the Byzantine and Fatimid soldiers in the past. We should recruit them as mercenaries to eliminate weak points in our army."

 ATC_idea_2: "Knights Hospitaller"

 ATC_idea_3: "Canons of The Holy Sepulchre"
 ATC_idea_3_desc: "Founded to protect the Church of The Holy Sepulchre, the Canons of The Holy Sepulchre helped us and the other crusaders in our holy wars. Their knowledge and discipline are widely known in the world, and their help to us will make our infantry force stronger."
 ATC_idea_4: "The Holy Lance"
 ATC_idea_4_desc: "Jesus Christ died because of our sins, and we should be all grateful because of that. We must remember him and his duty and embrace God's rules. The lance that pierced the side of Jesus, known as the Holy Lance, is in our capital Antioch. With that historical item, our people will remember that we should be united as Christians, stabilizing our nation even more."
 ATC_idea_5: "Knights of Tripoli"
 ATC_idea_5_desc: "The Knights of Tripoli don't just protect their nation, but they help to protect us against our foes. They know what brotherhood is, and they are ready to die for the faith. With their help, our numbers will increase significantly against our enemies."
 ATC_idea_6: "Seeking Protection"
 ATC_idea_6_desc: "There are so many Saracens who desire our lands and they will not stop until they finally take them. We are not afraid of death, but we can't defend these lands by ourselves for long. So we must seek protection from other faithful nations by improving our relations with them."
 ATC_idea_7: "Cultural Environment"
 ATC_idea_7_desc: "We just want to spread the true faith in these lands; any human being who believes Christianity is welcome in our lands, no matter his or her race. In the Eastern World, many people of different cultures coexist and we must respect every culture."

 EDE_idea_2: "Threats from Aleppo"
 EDE_idea_2_desc: "The destruction of the Fatimid Empire in the Levant has left a power vacuum that has strengthened local Muslim rulers. Sooner or later they will try to attack us, so we must arm ourselves against their attacks beforehand."
 EDE_idea_3: "Crucible of Christianity"
 EDE_idea_3_desc: "The native Christians are certainly not Catholics like us, but they are still our brothers in faith, who must be protected by us from the atrocities of their former Muslim rulers. After all, we must not simply abandon Edessa's long Christian tradition."
 EDE_idea_4: "Good Rapports with Armenians"
 EDE_idea_4_desc: "We can avoid revolts among our Armenian subjects by having our rulers always marry women of Armenian descent. At the same time, this will enable us to improve our relations with the Kingdom of Armenia as well."
 EDE_idea_5: "Multiple Imprisonments of our Counts"
 EDE_idea_5_desc: "During Muslim counterattacks and offensives by us, our counts often suffer the terrible fate of being captured by our enemies. Ransom payments put a noticeable strain on our treasury, so we should always have enough heirs to take over the affairs of state from imprisoned family members."
 EDE_idea_6: "Reestablish the School of Edessa"
 EDE_idea_6_desc: "Early on, Edessa developed into a center of theological scholarship, especially for Syrian and Aramaic Christianity. Ephrem the Syrian and Jacob of Edessa are probably the most famous theologians from Edessa. The school of Edessa experienced its zenith in the 4th century but quickly perished due to the persecution of Christians under the Sassanid Empire. We should transform Edessa back into the theological star it once was!"
 EDE_idea_7: "Ancient Routes"
 EDE_idea_7_desc: "Edessa is located at the crossroads of old trade routes. An east-west connection runs from Persia and Nisibis to a Euphrates ford near Samsat and the Mediterranean coast, a north-south connection goes from the Anatolian highlands and Amed to Carrhae and Syria. We should restore these old roads."

 AAN_idea_2: "Darial Pass"
 AAN_idea_2_desc: "The gateway across the Caucasus mountains is Darial Gorge, which lies in the Ossetian heartland, leading to its nickname 'Gate of the Alans'. By controlling this pass we control trade through the whole region."
 AAN_idea_3: "Religious Flexibility"
 AAN_idea_3_desc: "The native religion of the Alans is a form of Scythian Paganism called Ætsæg Din. However, the Alans frequently switched their nominal religious profession for diplomatic reasons, at times converting to the Judaism of the Khazars and at times the Orthodox Christianity of the Georgians and Byzantines."
 AAN_idea_4: "David Soslan"
 AAN_idea_4_desc: "The Alan royal Soslan married Georgia's greatest ruler, Queen Tamar, in 1187. All future Georgian monarchs up to the Russian conquest in the nineteenth century thus descend from Alans."
 AAN_idea_5: "Reconstruction"
 AAN_idea_5_desc: "The Kingdom of Alania was devastated by the conquests of the Mongols and Tamerlane, effectively being wiped out of existence. We need to rebuild Alania's infrastructure and allow the population to recover."
 AAN_idea_6: "Iron and Digor"
 AAN_idea_6_desc: "The Alan language is divided into two distinct dialects, Iron and Digor. We must foster a sense of unity between these two linguistic groups if we are to resist outside invaders."
 AAN_idea_7: "Publish the Nart Saga"
 AAN_idea_7_desc: "Central to the cultural and religious life of Alania is a collection of mythological texts called the Nart Saga. It recounts the stories of the early Alan hero clans like the Æxsærtægkatæ, Borætæ, and Alægatæ. As an oral tradition, we must commit it to writing to ensure its survival in the modern world."

 CMN_idea_3_desc: "Since the 10th century, the tribes of the Cumans and the Kipchak have formed a tribal confederation that extends from the Danube to the Irtysh. This alliance has made the two tribes the dominant power in the Eurasian steppe for a long time, often terrorizing nearby nations."

 CMN_idea_6: "Boniak the Mangy"
 CMN_idea_6_desc: "Boniak the Mangy is truly one of the most famous Cuman chiefs of all time. With his entourage, he invaded the Kievan Rus to plunder cities and monasteries and even burn down the palace of the Kievan prince in Berestove, thereby becoming the terror of the Rus. Later he obtained a spectacular victory against an army of the Hungarian king, confiscating royal treasures as a result."

 AHI_idea_1_desc: "The Westerners usually see us as barbarians thinking we are uncivilized people and not hesitating to justify their crusades against us by using this. But by giving our people the right to vote, we can show every nation that we are as civilized as they are and make our nation be heard by the whole world."
 AHI_idea_2: "Seven Rule of Ahis"

Open the austerity door, close the gluttony door. Open the ingenuity door, close the deliriousness door. Open the correctness door, close the fabrication door. And be on the side of Allah, not on the side of the public.' These seven rules guide our brotherhood, making us more resilient."
 AHI_idea_3: "No Kuffars Allowed"

 AHI_idea_4: "From Nomadic to Settled"
 AHI_idea_4_desc: "Many Turks have adopted the settled life and claimed many lands like Anatolia. But Anatolia is not fully Turkish. We must help our nomadic brothers adopt the settled life and make Anatolia a Turkish land once and for all."
 AHI_idea_5: "Ahi Scholars"
 AHI_idea_5_desc: "Even though we are a mercantile brotherhood, there are a lot of artists and sheiks who are members of our brotherhood. Our authority is growing in many beyliks with their help, and with their help more people are learning something. There will always be a scholar who will come to our aid when needed."
 AHI_idea_6: "Making Anatolia Muslim"
 AHI_idea_6_desc: "Our brotherhood spreads rapidly and nearly every village in Anatolia knows us. With rapid dissemination of our brotherhood, we can spread Islam in Anatolia, making the Islamization of Anatolia quicker."
 AHI_idea_7: "Influence on Beyliks"
 AHI_idea_7_desc: "There are a lot of members of our brotherhood in other beyliks, even among the Seljuks and Ottomans. Even the first Ottoman Padishahs are a member of our brotherhood. This helps us spread our influence to other nations and make them our friends."

 VDR_idea_1_desc: "The city of Vladimir was founded in its current form by Prince Vladimir Monomakh in 1108 AD. Monomakh took his name from his matrilineal relative Constantine Monomachos, Emperor of Rome in the East. Let no one doubt that Vladimir is the true Third Rome!"
 VDR_idea_2: "Pagan Conversion"
 VDR_idea_2_desc: "Our two major cities Suzdal and Vladimir were both founded in the tenth century on the wild northeast frontier of the Kievan Rus, where a mix of Baltic, Finnic, and Slavic pagans abounded in the untamed forests. Rulers like Yuri Dolgorukiy established strongholds across these borderlands to ensure Russian control and to provide nuclei for the work of Orthodox missionaries."
 VDR_idea_3: "Primus Inter Pares"
 VDR_idea_3_desc: "As the power of Kiev waned, the Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal emerged as the new de-facto leader of all the Rurikid lines, with its rulers also holding the coveted title Grand Prince of the Rus."
 VDR_idea_4: "Kremlins"
 VDR_idea_4_desc: "Of the stronghold cities that typify the original geography of Vladimir, their most defining feature may be their imposing Kremlins. The signature Russian domes and great stone walls that can be seen in Moskva or Suzdal warn our enemies about the unconquerable resilience of Vladimir to this day."
 VDR_idea_5: "Theotokos of Vladimir"
 VDR_idea_5_desc: "The most prized relic of Vladimir is its twelfth-century Constantinopolitan icon of the Virgin Eleusa, with the infant Christ hugged against her. The relic is believed to give divine protection to the city and to all who live under Vladimir's power."
 VDR_idea_6: "Muscovite Rivalry"
 VDR_idea_6_desc: "In the fourteenth century the originally minor appanage of Moskva achieved immense power and eventually supplanted Vladimir's role as protector of the Russian Metropolitan and Grand Princes of all Rus. We must not allow this to happen, even if it comes to internecine wars."
 VDR_idea_7: "White Monuments of Vladimir-Suzdal"
 VDR_idea_7_desc: "Some of Russia's greatest cultural sites, erected out of pure white limestone, stand in the cities of Vladimir and Suzdal and are collectively known as the White Monuments. These include the Cathedral of Saint Demetrius, the Golden Gate, and the Monastery of Saint Euthymius."

 HNS_idea_2: "Catalaunian Plains"
 HNS_idea_2_desc: "It took a massive coalition of Roman legions and Germanic allies to finally defeat the Huns at the decisive Battle of the Catalaunian Plains. Merovech, founder of the Merovingian dynasty, Odoacer, destroyer of the Western Roman Empire, Theodoric, Flavius Aetius, Childeric, and Attila were all present at the clash. We must learn from this defeat and never suffer such an embarrassment again."
 HNS_idea_3: "Kardost of Armenia"
 HNS_idea_3_desc: "In the sixth century, many of the North Caucasian Huns were baptised in the Christian faith by an Armenian missionary named Kardost. Kardost also, like other missionaries who went among pagans, developed a writing system for the Hunnic language."
 HNS_idea_4: "Khazar Ties"
 HNS_idea_4_desc: "The Huns were close allies of the Khazars, as attested by the Khazar client ruler Alp Iluetuer. We often helped them in their wars against the Caliphate, eventually joining the Khazar Khaganate until its disintegration in the tenth century."
 HNS_idea_5: "Kumyks"
 HNS_idea_5_desc: "Emerging into the modern era, the descendants of the Caucasian Huns became known as Kumyks and founded a variety of feudal states such as Endirey, Utamish, Braguny, Kaytag, and Djidan."
 HNS_idea_6: "Resist the Russians"
 HNS_idea_6_desc: "The perfidious Russians once destroyed the Khazar Khaganate, and have long tried to subjugate the peoples of the Caucasus. When Russian Tsar Peter I invaded Persia through the Kumyks in 1722, his troops were badly shaken at the Battle of the River Inchge. Peter observed 'If the Kumyks had a comprehension of Military Science, no other nation could take arms against them'."
 HNS_idea_7: "Tarki"
 HNS_idea_7_desc: "The city of Tarki is the traditional capital of the Kumyk people and also served as the capital of the Tarki Shamkhalate, the last state in all the Caucasus to fall to the Russians. Some have even theorized that Tarki is the site of the ancient Khazar capital Samandar."

 KHZ_idea_2: "Silk Road Trade"
 KHZ_idea_2_desc: "For centuries the Khazars commanded the gates to Europe along the 'Steppe Route' sub-branch of the famous Silk Road, bringing the Khans great riches from customs and taxes on Chinese merchants."
 KHZ_idea_3: "Hasdai ben Shaprut"
 KHZ_idea_3_desc: "A testament to the Jewish identity of the Khazar nobility comes in the form of correspondences between Hasdai ben Shaprut, the Jewish foreign secretary of the Caliph of Córdoba, and Joseph ben Aaron, Khan of Khazaria. In the letter Joseph explains how the Khazars converted to Judaism in the eighth century and how they maintain Jewish worship in their state."
 KHZ_idea_4: "Diarchy"
 KHZ_idea_4_desc: "The Khazar state was notable for its diarchic royal structure, with the dual positions of Shad and Kagan established to rule the Khazar people. The Shad controlled military affairs, while the Khagan was the symbolic head of state and active in diplomacy. Khagan coronation involved nearly strangling the Khagan until he offered a number of years he would rule, after which he would be ritually sacrificed."
 KHZ_idea_5: "Ursiyya"
 KHZ_idea_5_desc: "To maintain the power of the Khazar elites over the Oghuz and Alan masses, aristocrats relied on a corps of elite Khwarezmian mercenary guards called Ursiyya. The Ursiyya were the backbone of the Khazar army and deeply influential in the government, like later Mamluks or Janissaries."
 KHZ_idea_6: "Tuduns and Jawyshyghrs"
 KHZ_idea_6_desc: "The complex Khazar bureaucracy relied on various government positions like that of the Jawyshyghr, Kündür, and Tudun. Tuduns served as municipal governors and allowed the Khazar Khans to exert centralized power over vast areas."
 KHZ_idea_7: "Ashina Clan"
 KHZ_idea_7_desc: "The Ashina Clan was one of the ruling dynasties of the original Göktürk Khaganate, and went on to become the ruling family of Khazaria as well.

 SVN_idea_2: "George and Diocletian"
 SVN_idea_2_desc: "Many Christian communities have an iconographic tradition of Saint George slaying a dragon. The Svans are unique in our tradition of Saint George instead slaying Roman Emperor Diocletian, the very man who martyred him. This tradition represents our resistance to foreign Imperialism, from Caliphs and Basileis alike."
 SVN_idea_3: "Sa'Eristavo"
 SVN_idea_3_desc: "With the fall of the Kingdom of Abkhazia, Svanetia was inducted into the Georgian state as a Duchy or 'Saeristavo' governed by an Eristavi. In this period of feudal loyalty Georgian Queen Tamar would visit Svanetia annually and came to be seen as a quasi-goddess by the Svan people."

 SVN_idea_7: "Salt for Svanetia"
 SVN_idea_7_desc: "It is time for roadways to be established over the Caucasus mountains to connect pastoral Svanetia to the rest of the world and all its resources. After several Svan peasants were killed by an avalanche while trying to bring salt to their village, we cannot tolerate such isolation any longer."

 DBT_idea_1_desc: "The name 'Derbent' comes from the Persian word for 'gateway', 'darband'. The city stood as a reliable passage over the Caucasus range and was guarded in the Achaemenid and Sassanid eras as a Satrapy within the Persian sphere of influence."
 DBT_idea_2: "Walls of Khosrau"
 DBT_idea_2_desc: "The Old City of Derbent is surrounded by 66-foot high walls from the reign of the Sassanid Shah Khosrau I, son of Kavadh. The later Arab rulers of Derbent believed that the walls were one of the Seven Wonders of the World."
 DBT_idea_3: "Harun al-Rashid"
 DBT_idea_3_desc: "No Caliph is more widely respected by Muslims and non-Muslims alike than Harun al-Rashid, who oversaw the flourishing of the Islamic Golden Age. Harun lived in Derbent for part of his life and solidified its position as a center of Islamic culture and science."
 DBT_idea_4: "House of Derbent"
 DBT_idea_4_desc: "The Anushiruwanid or 'Shirvanshah' dynasty formed a cadet branch to rule Derbent that eventually inherited the main Shirvani state itself. The dynasty claimed descent from the Sassanids themselves, and was the longest continually-ruling dynasty in Muslim history."
 DBT_idea_5: "Mountain Jews"
 DBT_idea_5_desc: "From the time of the Khazars Derbent had a consistent Jewish population, being significant enough to find mention in the writings of Benjamin of Tudela. These Jews were connected to the so-called 'mountain Jews' that lived in the Caucasian foothills."
 DBT_idea_6: "History of Resistance"
 DBT_idea_6_desc: "The resistance of Derbent to the Arabs in 728 is immortalized in a monument in the city, but Derbent continued to stand against the imperial ambitions of the Safavids and the Russians throughout its history."
 DBT_idea_7: "Brandy"
 DBT_idea_7_desc: "Derbent Brandy is the most famous export of Derbent in its post-Russian-conquest era. Though Muslims may not drink it, other populations enjoy the delicacy in great amounts, bringing wealth and prestige to the city."

 armenian_ducal_idea_1_desc: "Tiridates III's conversion to Christianity in the fourth century after a miraculous cure made him the first monarchy in the entire world to accept Christianity as a state religion. While later converted states took different directions in what they considered orthodoxy, Armenia stuck to its maverick ways by rejecting the Council of Chalcedon and thus establishing an autonomous Oriental church."
 armenian_ducal_idea_2: "Lake Van"
 armenian_ducal_idea_2_desc: "The great lakes Van and Sevan stand at the center of the Armenian world, home to bustling fishing towns and even isolated island monasteries like Arter. As major natural barriers they force travellers to rely on Armenian infrastructure to guide them."
 armenian_ducal_idea_3: "Armenian Highlands"

 armenian_ducal_idea_4: "Bagratid Appanages"
 armenian_ducal_idea_4_desc: "The Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia was really a patchwork of cooperative feudal states under various Armenian dynasties and cadet branches. This means that even after the Kingdom technically fell to Byzantium, Armenian principalities continued to exist and could rapidly re-establish themselves in the following century."
 armenian_ducal_idea_5: "Manrankarchutyun"
 armenian_ducal_idea_5_desc: "Manuscript illumination is an integral part of Armenian piety and artistic expression. The richly illustrated gospels and psalters that Armenia exports can be recognized around the world for their distinctive style and excellent craftsmanship."
 armenian_ducal_idea_6: "Remembering Tigranes"
 armenian_ducal_idea_6_desc: "Armenia reached its greatest extent under Tigranes the Great in the first century BC, stretching all the way from Damascus to Antioch to the Caspian Sea. To this day Armenians consider Tigranes a national hero and a symbol of martial prowess."

 MRY_idea_2: "Macbeth"
 MRY_idea_2_desc: "The Moray dynasty, despite only ruling Scotland for a brief period, claims by far the most famous figure in Scottish royal history, King Macbeth. The tale of Macbeth and his deposition by Siward and Malcolm was immortalized by William Shakespeare in his fanciful tragedy in 1606."
 MRY_idea_3: "Inverness Castle"
 MRY_idea_3_desc: "Saint Columba visited the site that would become Inverness in the sixth century AD, leading to a continual Christian presence in the area that would culminate with the construction of a grand Scottish royal castle by Malcolm III. Even in the early modern era, Scottish Kings would often hold parliament in the aging fortress."
 MRY_idea_4: "The Great Glen"
 MRY_idea_4_desc: "The Scottish highlands are bisected by a large lake-filled valley called the Great Glen. It provides easy passage from Moray Firth to the Irish sea, making it key to controlling the Highland clans. After the Jacobite risings, many forts were built in the Glen to keep it secure."
 MRY_idea_5: "Moray Whaling"
 MRY_idea_5_desc: "Moray Firth is the greatest place in Britain for hunting whales and even more exotic creatures like bottlenose dolphins. Unfortunately, Moray Eels are etymologically unrelated and cannot be found in the Firth."
 MRY_idea_6: "Stewart Appanage"
 MRY_idea_6_desc: "After the fall of the Mormaerdom in 1130, Moray was resurrected as an Earldom and granted many times. Its most prestigious grant was to James Stewart, a natural son of King James IV. The title still has currency as a style in royal Peerage."
 MRY_idea_7: "Loch Ness Monster"

 MEI_idea_1_desc: "Meissen has often been nicknamed the 'cradle of Saxony', owing to its central position in the region and enduring importance through the centuries. Founded in 929 by Henry the Fowler, king of East Francia, on an ancient Slavic settlement, it quickly became one of the most important cities in Saxony."
 MEI_idea_2: "Albrechtsburg"
 MEI_idea_2_desc: "Meissen's roots can be traced back to the series of fortifications now known as Albrechtsburg, established as Meissen Castle in 929 between the Elbe and Triebisch rivers to protect East Frankish gains against the Slavic Glomacze tribe. In 1471 a castle was built on the site, but it was used as a residence rather than a fortress which made it the first in Germany to be used for that purpose."
 MEI_idea_3: "Wettin Legacy"
 MEI_idea_3_desc: "In 1089, the count of Eilenburg, Henry the Elder was granted the Margraviate of Meissen after the deposition of its previous Margrave who had opposed the Holy Roman Emperor. Henry was of the Wettin dynasty, whose members would rule Meissen and then the duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg after it was inherited in 1423. This has given Meissen a respectable legacy."
 MEI_idea_4: "Elbtal Wine Region"
 MEI_idea_4_desc: "Evidence of viticulture in the region around Meissen dates to 1161, and the city is located in the center of a small region ideal for the growth of vineyards despite its northern location. With our annual wine festivals we can cultivate new interest in a commodity that few places in Germany can offer."
 MEI_idea_5: "Edge of the Mongol Invasions"
 MEI_idea_5_desc: "In April 1241, a Mongol reconnaissance party led by Orda Khan annihilated a Polish force at Legnica. In the wake of this catastrophic defeat, there was nothing to stop the Mongol advance further into Germany. Meissen was at the very edge of the Mongols' swords, being the farthest west they had launched a raid. Most of the town was burned to the ground, but we have been able to use this experience and learn from it. Now, we will not yield an inch when there is an invader at our doorstep."
 MEI_idea_6: "Burgraviate of Meissen"
 MEI_idea_6_desc: "The burgrave was a military governor of a castle and its surrounding environs. Meissen was granted one such burgraviate in the 12th century during the Ostsiedlung, being only one of a few cities in Germany to receive such a distinction. The Meinheringer family would rise to prominence in this position as the status of burgrave became more prestigious over time."
 MEI_idea_7: "Meissener Porcelain"
 MEI_idea_7_desc: "Meissen is famous worldwide for its porcelain; it was the first high-quality porcelain to be produced anywhere outside of East Asia, pioneered by the alchemist Johann Friedrich Böttger in 1710. For a time, the city held a monopoly on its production as very few artisans knew the methods required to make porcelain. Meissen took its porcelain manufacturing so seriously that a trademarked 'crossed swords' logo was used to identify their original products."

But nowhere were they more established than in Brunswick itself. The Welfs were so influential in politics that the Guelph-Ghibelline conflict resulted from the Welfs siding with the Pope in the Investiture Controversy."
# BRU_idea_2: "Dankwarderode Castle"
# BRU_idea_2_desc: "Dankwarderode Castle was the main residence of the dukes of Brunswick, built by Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony and Bavaria, in the 12th century. It is located on an island in the river Oker, giving it a strategic importance."
# BRU_idea_3: "The Brunswick Lion"
# BRU_idea_3_desc: "When Henry the Lion resided in Brunswick, he erected a lion statue in the center of the complex of Dankwarderode Castle. This not only served to demonstrate Henry's own authority, but also his claim against the Hohenstaufens whose coat of arms used three lions. The lion sculpture was a remarkable feat for the Middle Ages and proved so popular that the lion became the heraldic animal of Brunswick and was used on ducal coins, even spawning a legend of its own known as the Heinrichssage."
# BRU_idea_4: "Powerful Burghers"
# BRU_idea_4_desc: "Brunswick was among the richest of cities in Northern Europe during the later Middle Ages, and was a member of the Hanseatic League from the 13th century onward. In these conditions, an independent class of patricians and guildsmen flourished, so much so that the city was de facto under their rule."
# BRU_idea_5: "Reunite the Principalities"
# BRU_idea_5_desc: "The Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg was subdivided several times among various principalities including Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Göttingen and Calenberg. This has done nothing but weaken our nation so far; as they all belong to the same house, it is only right that they be reunited."
# BRU_idea_6: "Collegium Carolinum"
# BRU_idea_6_desc: "Founded in 1745 by Duke Charles I, the Collegium demonstrated his patronage of the arts and sciences. The college was home to many important personalities such as the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. With this, we can attract many influential thinkers to the city and spread the ideas of the Enlightenment."
# BRU_idea_7: "The Black Brunswickers"
# BRU_idea_7_desc: "Formed in 1809 as an army unit opposing Napoleon Bonaparte, the Brunswick Ducal Corps were infamous for their black uniforms which gave them the nickname 'Black Brunswickers'. Led by Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, the corps would earn a fearsome reputation during the later Napoleonic Wars, taking part at the battle of Quatre Bras in June 1815 where the Duke valiantly fought, but ultimately perished."

King Louis XII and King Francis I made the castle their main residence, who expanded it with enormous libraries and magnificent gardens, thus transforming it into a castle worthy not of a count but of a king!"
 XBL_idea_2: "Rivalry with Anjou"
 XBL_idea_2_desc: "For a long time, there was a rivalry between the Counts of Blois and the neighbouring Counts of Anjou. They did not only compete for castles and towns in north-western France, but later also for the English throne. By studying them closely, we will always have an ace up our sleeves whenever our armies clash again."
 XBL_idea_3: "Loire Castles"
 XBL_idea_3_desc: "The Loire is the longest and most important river in France, stretching over 1000 kilometers. Thanks to the beauty of the river valley, the French nobility erected dozens of impressive Renaissance castles here, which made Blois an important center of France."

 XBL_idea_4_desc: "With the purchase of the relics of Saint Solène, the construction of the Cathedral of Blois began at the end of the 9th century, turning the village into a city that was popular among pilgrims. In the centuries that followed, the cathedral was continually renovated, extended and enlarged, only increasing its splendor."
 XBL_idea_5: "Last Anglo-Norman King"
 XBL_idea_5_desc: "King Stephen I was not only a son of Count Stephen Henry of Blois but also a grandson of William the Conqueror, King of England. After the death of King Henry I, Stephen raised an army and successfully usurped the English throne from his aunt. Unfortunately, he could not convince the Pope to appoint his son as his successor. As a result, Henry II succeeded him to the throne, founding the Angevin dynasty and ending the rule of the Anglo-Normans."
 XBL_idea_6: "King of Navarra"
 XBL_idea_6_desc: "With the coronation of Theobald I in 1234, the Kingdom of Navarra came under the control of the House of Blois, which would rule it for fifty years.

 XBL_idea_7: "Liberator of Orléans"

 SYR_idea_3_desc: "Syrian cities like Aleppo became centers of Muslim resistance against the Christian crusaders during the age of crusades. Not only were many refugees received from the Levant, but counter-offensives were planned and launched from here to drive the crusaders out again."
 SYR_idea_4: "Jund Revival"
 SYR_idea_4_desc: "During the time of the Rashidun Caliphate, Syria was divided into so-called 'Junds', which were taken over and further developed by the Umayyad Caliphs. This military division did not only help the Caliphs to effectively manage the conquered territories, but also regulated the mobilization of soldiers here. We should revive this administrative structure to benefit from it ourselves."
 SYR_idea_5: "Preservation of Churches"

 TLC_ideas_start: "Tlemceni Traditions"
 TLC_ideas_bonus: "Tlemceni Ambition"
 TLC_idea_1: "Tell Atlas Farming"
 TLC_idea_1_desc: "Between the Tell Atlas Mountains and the Barbary Coast sits a fertile region which has facilitated the growth of cities across our sultanate, especially on the river Chelif. We must take full advantage of its productivity by introducing new farming methods."
 TLC_idea_2: "Enduring Sultanate"
 TLC_idea_2_desc: "The Marinids, ruling Morocco to the west, have always harbored ambitions of subjugating the people of Tlemcen. But when the Moroccan sultan Abu Inan Faris tried to occupy our lands in the 14th century, the local Berbers revolted and successfully drove them out. This has shown the unyielding resolve of our people - even as our soil is devastated, we will not give it up."
 TLC_idea_3: "Unite the Berbers"
 TLC_idea_3_desc: "The Berber tribesmen within our state have often posed the biggest threat to our continued existence, rather than the neighboring sultanates. This must be rectified by maintaining a national identity and a sense of unity among the warring Berbers so that they may fight under our banner instead of their own."
 TLC_idea_4: "Commerce of the Atlas Mountains"
 TLC_idea_4_desc: "Tlemcen since its inception has become the principal trading hub in the central Maghreb, in no small part due to its strategic position near the Atlas Mountains. Its location on the trade route linking Sijilmassa and Oran makes it ideal for the trans-Saharan caravans to pass through; meanwhile, the route to Fez is far less favorable due to the mountainous terrain. Even Barbary corsairs are growing the economy by acquiring goods from the Mediterranean and selling them at Tlemcen. Furthermore, Europeans have even recognized the importance of Tlemcen, with a 'funduk' (trading center) being established there."
 TLC_idea_5: "Wars with Ifriqiya"
 TLC_idea_5_desc: "Throughout the 15th century, the Zayyanids attempted to expand east into the Hafsid sultanate of Ifriqiya numerous times, but ultimately were unsuccessful. However, these wars have given us much-needed experience - let us apply it to our successful conquests."
 TLC_idea_6: "Madrasas of Tlemcen"
 TLC_idea_6_desc: "Tlemcen has an abundance of madrasas and religious institutions which have made it the foremost intellectual center of the central Maghreb. We can leverage the power and wealth of the mosques to propagate the Muslim faith further afield, especially to the Berbers who have resisted conversion in the past."
 TLC_idea_7: "Curtail Arab Nomads"
 TLC_idea_7_desc: "In the past we have relied heavily on Arab nomads to fight our wars, and while they can be effective, they can also be difficult to rein in. We must eschew the old ways of warfare and grow a modern standing army with troops loyal to the Sultan if we are to put up a fight against outside threats."
#Ponthieu
 PIC_ideas: "Ponthieuis Ideas"
 PIC_ideas_start: "Ponthieuis Traditions"
 PIC_ideas_bonus: "Ponthieuis Ambition"
 PIC_idea_1: "Capture of Harold Godwinson"
 PIC_idea_1_desc: "In 1064, according to the Bayeux Tapestry, Harold Godwinson, the Earl of Wessex, was sailing across the English Channel when he was blown off course and shipwrecked on the shores of Ponthieu. Count Guy I had him taken prisoner and brought to William of Normandy, where Harold allegedly swore on holy relics to support William's claim to the English throne. And so when Harold had himself crowned king of England, the Normans saw him as a usurper which led to the successful Norman invasion of England. Perhaps that invasion may never have come to fruition without our intervention."
 PIC_idea_2: "Carmen de Hastingae Proelio"
 PIC_idea_2_desc: "The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio (Song of the Battle of Hastings) was the earliest known written account of the Norman invasion of England, attributed to Bishop Guy of Amiens who was the uncle of the Count of Ponthieu."
 PIC_idea_3: "Fortress of Crotoy"
 PIC_idea_3_desc: "In 1150, the Count Jean I built a fortress at Crotoy located on a strategic point at the river Somme. The fortress was later expanded by Edward III of England when he invaded France in 1340, but remained in French hands right up until 1424, being the last fortress near the Somme to surrender to English forces."
 PIC_idea_4: "English Fief"
 PIC_idea_4_desc: "Whereas the other counties of Picardy were subsumed into the French royal domain, Ponthieu diverged as it was integrated into the kingdom of England as a fief instead for much of the 14th century. This has given us experience in administering fiefdoms the English way."
 PIC_idea_5: "Port of Abbeville"
 PIC_idea_5_desc: "Abbeville was the principal city of the county of Ponthieu and was a trading center in its own right in Northern France. Although its economic fortunes declined after the 14th century with the Black Death and the Hundred Years' War, before then the city was known for its salt and woad trades."
 PIC_idea_6: "Constant Battleground"
 PIC_idea_6_desc: "Ponthieu has been contested for centuries between powerful rivals in the region such as England, France, Burgundy and even Austria when they inherited the Burgundian Netherlands. This has left Ponthieu in a unique position where they are well suited to utilizing the tactics of their invaders to their advantage."
 PIC_idea_7: "Refuge of Bretons and Normans"
 PIC_idea_7_desc: "During the Great Famine of 1693-94, worsening conditions in Normandy and Brittany forced many people to seek refuge in nearby territories of France, including Ponthieu. We decided to take in anyone we could, even if we couldn't save them."
#Cappadocia
 CPP_ideas: "Cappadocian Ideas"
 CPP_ideas_start: "Cappadocian Traditions"
 CPP_ideas_bonus: "Cappadocian Ambition"
 CPP_idea_1: "Splendid Cave Architecture"
 CPP_idea_1_desc: "After the invasion of the Isaurians in the 4th century, the Huns in the 5th century and finally Persian groups in the 6th century, the latter conquering Caesarea in 605, the intensive construction of both underground and above ground cave structures and entire cities began. The buildings were mainly built for security and defense aspects. After 642, when Arabs began to invade the region, these aspects became increasingly important, so that for three centuries Christian communities lived here in hiding and protected against attackers. Under the following period of Byzantine rule, Christianity and with it Christian architecture flourished in Cappadocia. Until the 11th century, about 3000 churches were hewn out of the stone."
 CPP_idea_2: "Mazaca"
 CPP_idea_2_desc: "Mazaca is one of the oldest cities in Anatolia, which was the seat of the kings of Cappadocia in ancient times. After the conquest by Alexander the Great, he transferred it to his general Eumenes of Cardia, whereupon it became an important military base. After the Hellenization, the city was first called Eusebia, then Caesarea, both times named after Cappadocian kings."
 CPP_idea_3: "Love Valley"
 CPP_idea_3_desc: "The so-called Love Valley is a hidden valley situated on a high plateau of Cappadocia, full of strange rock formations near Korama. Some believe that these stone structures look like the male genitals."
 CPP_idea_4: "Heretical Crucible"
 CPP_idea_4_desc: "Over time, Cappadocia became susceptible to heresies, especially Paulicianism. We have learned to deal better with heretics as a result."
 CPP_idea_5: "Militarized Frontier Zone"
 CPP_idea_5_desc: "Cappadocia served the Byzantine Empire for centuries as a well-fortified line of defense in the east of the empire. Only the Seljuks were able to overcome the Cappadocian defences in the long run."
 CPP_idea_6: "Cappadocian Fathers"
 CPP_idea_6_desc: "The collective term 'Three Cappadocian Fathers' refers to the three Cappadocian theologians Basil the Great, his younger brother Gregory of Nyssa and his elder fellow student Gregory of Nazianzus, who played a decisive role in the Trinitarian victory in the Arian conflict of the 4th century. They sought a theologically deeper understanding of the First Council of Nicaea and did preparatory work for the First Council of Constantinople."
 CPP_idea_7: "Armenian Refuge"
 CPP_idea_7_desc: "Cappadocia shared an always-changing relationship with neighbouring Armenia, by that time a region of the Empire. The Arab historian Abu Al Faraj asserts the following about Armenian settlers in Sivas, during the 10th century: 'Sivas, in Cappadocia, was dominated by the Armenians and their numbers became so many that they became vital members of the imperial armies. These Armenians were used as watch-posts in strong fortresses, taken from the Arabs. They distinguished themselves as experienced infantry soldiers in the imperial army and were constantly fighting with outstanding courage and success by the side of the Romans, in other words, Byzantines.'"
#Isauria

 ISU_ideas_start: "Isaurian Traditions"
 ISU_ideas_bonus: "Isaurian Ambition"
 ISU_idea_1: "Robbers, Pirates and Slave Traders"
 ISU_idea_1_desc: "In ancient times, the Isaurians were feared as robbers, pirates, slave traders and warriors, who made careers as soldiers in the Byzantine army from the late 5th century onwards and were used by Emperor Leo I as a counterweight to the Gothic troops."
 ISU_idea_2: "Isaurian Rebellion"
 ISU_idea_2_desc: "After Emperor Zeno, who was born in Isauria, was overthrown by the inhabitants of Constantinople and the Isaurian population of the city was exterminated, Isauria rose up against the new Emperor Anastasius I. Unfortunately, the rebellion was crushed by the Emperor, but we can learn from the mistakes of the past and dare a new rebellion."
 ISU_idea_3: "Alahan Monastery"
 ISU_idea_3_desc: "The Alahan Monastery represents an impressive 5th-century monastery in the south of Isauria, which was completed under Emperor Zeno. The complex contains two churches, rock-cut chambers, a baptistery, living quarters, and many other spaces, like a forecourt, necropolis, bathhouse, and lower terrace. There is debate about the monastery’s original purpose, but it nonetheless became a communal living space for monks and those seeking pilgrimage."
 ISU_idea_4: "Taurus Mountains"
 ISU_idea_4_desc: "The Taurus Mountains are a 1500 km long mountain range that extends from the south of Anatolia to its east. It is an excellent natural defence for us."
 ISU_idea_5: "Isaurian Ascendancy"
 ISU_idea_5_desc: "Although Isauria was a poor and neglected area in the Byzantine Empire, Zeno was the first and only Emperor who came from Isauria. His legitimacy was doubted because of his origin, which led to many revolts in the Empire. Nevertheless, he supported his homeland economically and culturally."
 ISU_idea_6: "Salt Lake"
 ISU_idea_6_desc: "Lake Tatta is a large lake in the middle of Anatolia; it does not contain freshwater but saltwater. It allows us to mine large salt deposits, which will help us to achieve great wealth."
 ISU_idea_7: "Isaurian Dynasty"
 ISU_idea_7_desc: "The Isaurians were despised by the other peoples of the Byzantine Empire as semi-barbarians. Emperor Leo III founded the Isaurian Dynasty with his coronation in 717, although he came from Syria, which can only be explained by the mistake of a chronicler. We should use this to cleanse the reputation of Isauria!"
#Phrygia

 PHR_idea_1: "Meander Valley"
 PHR_idea_1_desc: "The Meander is a 380 km long river that flows through western Anatolia, making it one of the most important rivers in Anatolia. It will provide our people with freshwater for eternity."
 PHR_idea_2: "Montanism"
 PHR_idea_2_desc: "Montanism is an early Christian heresy that originated in Phrygia around 160 AD. The members believed to possess revelations of the Holy Spirit, which had been given to their founder Montanus in view of the near end of the world. Their strict ethics were aimed at a renewal and perfection of the ecclesiastical order of life. Montanism extended to Syria and Thrace. Montanism also found approval in North Africa, where the Christian tradition was marked by the idea of martyrdom and the emphasis on the gifts of the Spirit, and finally spread to the West from about 200 AD onwards. The Roman Empire was close to opting for Montanism."
 PHR_idea_3: "King Midas"
 PHR_idea_3_desc: "The legendary King Midas of Phrygia is said to have received the prophecy already in his childhood that he would one day become very rich. Through a trick, Midas managed to get the god Dionysus to grant him a wish. He wished that everything he touched would turn to gold. But since food and drink now also became gold, he was threatened with death by hunger or thirst. So he asked the god to take back his gift. Dionysus advised him to bathe in the river Paktolos, to which the gift was then transferred, so that it became the gold richest river in Asia Minor."
 PHR_idea_4: "City Alliances"
 PHR_idea_4_desc: "In ancient times, the cities of Phrygia formed strong city alliances with which they could defend themselves against stronger invaders."
 PHR_idea_5: "Gordian Knot"
 PHR_idea_5_desc: "The term 'Gordian Knot' originally refers to artistically knotted ropes which, according to Greek legend, were attached to the chariot of the Phrygian king Gordios. The knot became famous because Alexander the Great is said to have cut it with his sword. This is the origin of today's metaphor, according to which the overcoming of a difficult problem by energetic or unconventional means is equated with 'undoing the Gordian knot'."
 PHR_idea_6: "Cult of Dionysus"
 PHR_idea_6_desc: "The ancient god Dionysos - also called Bakchos by the Greeks, Bacchus by the Romans - has an exoteric and an esoteric appearance. The exoteric Dionysus is a funny, harmless god of wine, while the esoteric Dionysus is a god of fundamentally serious dimension. He is the counterpart of the god of the underworld: for if it were not Dionysus, to whom they make the procession and sing the song of Phallos, otherwise it would be quite a shameless activity. But Hades and Dionysus are one and the same, and they rave and celebrate him, says Heraclitus."
 PHR_idea_7: "Seljuk Relationship"
 PHR_idea_7_desc: "After the Seljuk Sultan Kaykhusraw I was deposed around 1200, the Phrygian nobleman Manuel Maurozomes helped Kaykhusraw I to regain the throne. As a reward, he was allowed to rule Phrygia as a vassal of the Seljuks and played an important role at the Seljuk court. His descendants, who kept their Christian faith, were also present at the Seljuk court until the end of the 13th century."

 BGH_idea_6: "Turkish Cavalry"
 BGH_idea_6_desc: "We have the powerful Daylamite infantry at our disposal, but we still lack cavalry. The Turkish will surely increase the strength of our army."
 BGH_idea_7: "Religious Toleration"
 BGH_idea_7_desc: "We are Shia, have Zoroastrian roots, and rule over many Sunni territories. To maintain stability, it is necessary to prevent religious conflicts. Christians can be appointed to government positions if the need arises."

 VLW_idea_6_desc: "After the disastrous Battle of Agincourt, French forces were badly in need of a major victory. It was thought that had the English captured the important city of Orléans, they would be the next to control the French Crown. Joan of Arc, a French peasant girl, claimed to be able to lead the French to victory. Sure enough, just nine days after she showed up to Orléans, the siege was over and the French were the victors."

He was rapidly canonized after his martyrdom and is now immortalized in Saint Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall."
 ORK_idea_3: "Jarldom"
 ORK_idea_3_desc: "Orkney is an 'Earldom' not because it originated with an Anglo-Saxon earl but because it was first entrusted to local Norwegian jarls, a line of Norse chieftains with sweeping autonomy from the Norwegian state. We must preserve this tradition of autonomy and confirm our status as jarls."
 ORK_idea_4: "Thalassocracy"

This national responsibility considerably broadened the scope of the Church's mission."
 CLC_idea_5: "Legitimized by the Emperor"
 CLC_idea_5_desc: "To strengthen the independence of his principality against Byzantium, Leo II pursued a policy of rapprochement with the Holy Roman Empire.

 CLC_idea_6: "Learning from the Franks"
 CLC_idea_6_desc: "It was not the Byzantine Empire who was able to defeat our Muslim enemies. It was the foreign Franks who could drive the infidels out of the Levant. We should learn from Frankish warfare to improve our army tactics."
 CLC_idea_7: "Georgian Ties"

 PIE_idea_1: "Barbera"
 PIE_idea_1_desc: "In southern Piedmont, the landscape is dominated by smooth hills. There farmers grow grapes, thanks to the temperate climate and fertile soil, and very early on Piedmont became one of the main wine producers in Italy. The most famous Piedmontese wine is called 'Barbera', a strong red wine very appreciated with beef."
 PIE_idea_2: "King of the Hills"
 PIE_idea_2_desc: "Piedmont, at the beginning of its history, was a very fragmented land, with many local rulers fighting with each other for the control of little pieces of land. They all were vassals in various forms to the duke of Turin, that left them with large autonomy. Over the centuries, however, the central authority decided that it had to put an end to this situation, and gradually centralized the country."
 PIE_idea_3: "Esercito Permanente"
 PIE_idea_3_desc: "Piedmont was the only country in Italy that relied on a permanent army for war; while other Italian countries hired mercenaries when needed, Piedmont required military service from its peasants. The unlucky men were extracted and had to abandon their homes for many years. This approach, at first very unpopular among the population, became the successful principle of the Savoyard army."
 PIE_idea_4: "Bigger Piedmont"
 PIE_idea_4_desc: "The Piedmontese culture is very young; in the past, the whole region was simply known as 'Western Lombardy'. Piedmont fought hard to distinguish itself from the Lombards, converting many places to Piedmontese culture. Some places were ethnically French, like Aosta or Savoy, others were more similar to the Lombards, like eastern Piedmont. Gradually, the newly conquered regions were converted into Piedmontese culture and language."
 PIE_idea_5: "Soldati Piemontesi"
 PIE_idea_5_desc: "The military service changed the Piedmontese mentality: once quiet and peaceful farmers, the Piedmontese people became disciplined soldiers. Every Piedmontese knew he was also a soldier, and whenever France invaded Piedmont, the young people fled to the mountains to fight the French for their country and their king, without the need of a general. That's why in Italian 'Piedmontese soldier' is a common saying for very dutiful people."
 PIE_idea_6: "Politecnico di Torino"
 PIE_idea_6_desc: "Piedmont has always been interested in technology and science. While the rest of Italy was more specialized in Philosophy and Art, the rulers of Turin subsidized young chemists and engineers to make Piedmont a technological powerhouse. This is why a new type of school was built: the Politecnico, a new place where engineers, technicians and architects could study."
 PIE_idea_7: "House di Savoia"
 PIE_idea_7_desc: "The house di Savoia became the rightful rulers of Piedmont after the marriage of Adelaide Arduinici with Oddone di Savoia, count of Savoy and duke of Aosta. The house of Savoia is an old and powerful family, which became one of the most important dynasties in Europe over the centuries.

 WSX_idea_2_desc: "Wessex pioneered the system of shired land in the eighth century, dividing up holdings into 'hundreds' and 'shires' headed by a sheriff or shire-reeve. This system was so effective that it gradually spread throughout the British Isles and remained in use for over a thousand years afterward."
 WSX_idea_3: "Winchester"
 WSX_idea_3_desc: "The jewel of Wessex is its capital city Winchester, built on the site of a great Roman metropolis called Venta Castrum. The city's layout is designed specifically to defend against Viking incursions, and its bishop is one of the most important religious leaders in England."
 WSX_idea_4: "Battle of Edington"
 WSX_idea_4_desc: "When the Great Heathen Army and Great Summer Army were ravaging England and setting the roots of the Danelaw, the Kingdom of Wessex was the only state to resist their initial onslaught and organize resistance against them. After retreating to the Somerset Levels, King Ælfred engaged the Vikings at the Battle of Edington in 878 and defeated them decisively, freeing all of Wessex from their godless influence."
 WSX_idea_5: "Cynegils"
 WSX_idea_5_desc: "Cynegils was the first Christian King of Wessex, converting under the direction of the bishop Birinus some time in the mid seventh century. This makes Wessex one of the first Christian states among the Anglo-Saxon people, possibly beating out the conversion of Mercia."
 WSX_idea_6: "Channel Trade"
 WSX_idea_6_desc: "The Kingdom of Wessex straddles the English Channel, including the strategic Isle of Wight. This brings us into close contact with continental Europeans and the Franks, and permits easy travel and trade with our continental brethren."
 WSX_idea_7: "A Cross Patonce Or"
 WSX_idea_7_desc: "The attributed coat of arms of Wessex features an azure field with a cross patonce cantoned by four martlets or. This symbol was derived from the coinage of King Edward the Confessor, whose piety and steadfastness brings glory to the West Saxon realm through this connection."
#Mercia
 MCI_ideas: "Mercian Ideas"
 MCI_ideas_start: "Mercian Traditions"
 MCI_ideas_bonus: "Mercian Ambition"
 MCI_idea_1: "Restore Mercian Supremacy"
 MCI_idea_1_desc: "The period from 600-900 AD was known as the 'Mercian Supremacy', where Mercia dominated the other Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms of the Heptarchy for centuries on end. It can be said that Mercia was indeed the first state to unite all the Anglo-Saxon people, even before the more famous unification by the Kings of Wessex. We must return to this glorious time by re-asserting our dominance over the South!"
 MCI_idea_2: "King Offa"
 MCI_idea_2_desc: "In 757, Offa of Mercia restored the prestige of the Mercian Kingdom by defeating various warring pretenders and led the state to its golden age, establishing control over all his neighbors and bringing the arrogant church to heel. Offa has been immortalized by the many coins issued during his reign which survive to the present day."
 MCI_idea_3: "Midlands"
 MCI_idea_3_desc: "The Kingdom of Mercia spans across the English Midlands, one of the most strategically commanding and fertile regions of the British Isles. With the Midlands under our control, our people will never go hungry, and we can mediate travel from all sides of Great Britain."
 MCI_idea_4: "Composite State"
 MCI_idea_4_desc: "Mercia did not come into existence as a single entity. It was built out of a series of existing smaller polities, including three different groups of Mercians, Welshmen, the Kingdom of Lindsey, the Kingdom of Hwicce, the Middle Angles and the Middle Saxons."
 MCI_idea_5: "Offa's Dyke"
 MCI_idea_5_desc: "One of King Offa's greatest building projects was the construction of Offa's Dyke, a defensive ditch dug along the entire Welsh border to ensure the safety of Mercia from Welsh aggression. We must keep this fortification maintained and apply the same technique to our other vulnerable borders."
 MCI_idea_6: "Peada"
 MCI_idea_6_desc: "The first Christian King of Mercia was Peada, who ascended the throne after the heathen Penda was killed at the Battle of the Winwaed in 655. The greatest attestation of Mercian Christianity after Peada's conversion is the Lichfield Gospel, an illuminated gospel collection created in the 730s, in the same Insular style of the Book of Kells."
 MCI_idea_7: "Cross of St Alban"
 MCI_idea_7_desc: "Just like the Kingdoms of Alba and Strathclyde, Mercia is represented by a saltire, yellow on blue. This symbol was associated with the Abbey of Saint Albans founded by King Offa, dedicated to Britain's first Saint. It is said that Alban saved a priest from the Roman authorities in the third or fourth century and was subsequently martyred via beheading."

 AHL_ideas_start: "Ahlatian Traditions"
 AHL_ideas_bonus: "Ahlatian Ambition"
 AHL_idea_1: "Kings of Armenia"
 AHL_idea_1_desc: "The rulers of Ahlat were dubbed 'Shah-Armens', Kings of Armenia, with the understanding that they had taken up the ancient mantle of Armenian Kingship from the recently-defunct Armenian Bagratid dynasty. This fixes our state as part of a grand historical legacy stretching back to ancient Persia and the Orontid dynasty of the sixth century BC."
 AHL_idea_2: "Lake Van"
 AHL_idea_2_desc: "Ahlat lies on the shores of Lake Van, and the original state of the Shah-Armens essentially surrounded the whole body of water. The Lake is thus important to our mercantile enterprises and communication across the Shahdom, and by improving our shipping we can greatly improve the speed and efficiency of our merchants."
 AHL_idea_3: "Humble Origins"
 AHL_idea_3_desc: "The founder of the Shah-Armens was a certain Sökmen el-Kutbî, a Turkic slave in service of the great Seljuk Shah. Sökmen captured the city of Ahlat in the wake of the Battle of Manzikert and then gradually expanded his power over the surrounding towns while always remaining loyal to the Seljuk state. As a reward for his unwavering loyalty, he was finally granted Ahlat as an Iqta in 1110, one year before he died, but not before founding a lasting dynasty."
 AHL_idea_4: "Crossroads of Anatolia"
 AHL_idea_4_desc: "The Ahlat region stands at the crossroad between Anatolia and Iran, and as such was coveted by its neighbors for its strategic value. The flat plain around the city of Bayazid in particular has been used since time immemorial by armies traversing the Armenian Highlands to rest and graze their horses in the middle of the journey."
 AHL_idea_5: "Shahbanu's Restorations"
 AHL_idea_5_desc: "During the reign of Sökmen II, his wife Shahbanu of the neighboring Saltuqid dynasty undertook a series of restoration projects that brought Ahlat to its zenith. She replaced the decaying wooden bridges with stone, rebuilt the ruined fortress, repaired the roads and even constructed new inns for visitors. An entirely new city called Sukmanabad was also founded in honor of the Shah."
 AHL_idea_6: "Ahlat Gravestones"
 AHL_idea_6_desc: "The most lasting legacy of the Shah-Armens was their unique, richly decorated 'Ahlat tombstones' which can be seen to this day in their capital city. The stones feature intricate Kufic designs as well as hand-carved interlocking geometric patterns that arrest the viewer with their skill and beauty."
 AHL_idea_7: "Kurdistan"
 AHL_idea_7_desc: "In the Early Modern era, the region around Ahlat was divided between several de-facto independent Kurdish principalities who resisted the authority of the Ottoman Empire. The Principality of Bayazid was ruled by a series of strongmen including the great Ishak Pasha who defended the Empire's eastern flank from the Safavids and who built an imposing stone palace near the city center."

 ALW_ideas_bonus: "Al-Wahati Ambition"
 ALW_idea_1: "Kharga"
 ALW_idea_1_desc: "The first of Egypt's seven oases, Kharga is the largest of the Libyan Desert and was consequently known to the Romans as Oasis Magna. The imposing Temple of Hibis is the only remnant of this Roman past, but the oasis is known today for its importance to the Darb Al-Arbain caravan route."
 ALW_idea_2: "Dakhla"
 ALW_idea_2_desc: "The second of Egypt's seven oases, Dakhla has unparalleled water access due to the underground Nubian Aquifer. The Ayyubids fortified the oasis with the construction of Al-Qasr to protect their southern flank from raiders and hostile invasion forces."
 ALW_idea_3: "Farafra"
 ALW_idea_3_desc: "The third of Egypt's seven oases, Farafra is the least populated but is surrounded by a beautiful 'White Desert' of chalk rocks that has been considered a marvel since Roman times. Many springs irrigate the oasis and allow cultivation of citrus, olives, dates, and apricots."
 ALW_idea_4: "Bahariya"
 ALW_idea_4_desc: "The fourth of Egypt's seven oases, Bahariya was known to the Romans as Oasis Parva in contrast with Kharga. Like Farafra, it is known for its crop cultivation, but also contains iron ore deposits that are important for any oasis-based military."
 ALW_idea_5: "Fayyum"
 ALW_idea_5_desc: "The fifth of Egypt's seven oases, Fayyum is closest to the Nile river and perhaps the most well-irrigated due to its position on the side of Lake Moeris. The lake even allows the oasis to have a prominent fishing industry, though its greatest fame is the collection of well-preserved Roman-era encaustic paintings known as the 'Fayyum mummy portraits'."
 ALW_idea_6: "Siwa"
 ALW_idea_6_desc: "The sixth of Egypt's seven oases, Siwa has the most distinct culture of all of them due to its isolated native Berber population in contrast to the usual Bedouin Arabs. Its inhabitants thus speak a peculiar dialect called Siwi, and were some of the last of the oases-dwellers to convert to Islam. Their oasis is vaunted for its ancient Temple of Amun-Ra where a great oracle once lived."
 ALW_idea_7: "Qarah"
 ALW_idea_7_desc: "The seventh of Egypt's seven oases, Qarah is an adjunct to the Siwa oasis and is much smaller than all others. The British explorer William George Browne passed through in 1792 on his way to Darfur and wrote about his experiences for the British public, though he was murdered before continuing his travels."

 VYT_idea_1: "Veche of Hlynov"
 VYT_idea_1_desc: "Though Novgorod and Pskov are more famous, there were actually three Veche Republics in Russia. Hlynov originated as a Novgorodian outpost but soon became an independent state where a popular Veche Council decided affairs of state on behalf of all free men."
 VYT_idea_2: "Vyatich Origins"
 VYT_idea_2_desc: "Many Slavic tribes inhabited the forests of Eastern Europe and gradually consolidated into the Kievan state. The Vyatiches were spread throughout the region that would become Muscovy, and in their northeast reaches melded with the local Finnic populations to form the population that would become the Hlynov Republic. In effect, our state has connections both to our Russian and Ugrian neighbors."
 VYT_idea_3: "Ushkuiniks"
 VYT_idea_3_desc: "The Vikings left some influence on the Russian people in the form of Ushkuiniks, renegade tribes who adopted their ways and used rivers to maraud and loot settled cities. Ushkuiniks travelling to and from Volga Bulgaria are a major problem for our state, so we must work out some kind of arrangement with them."
 VYT_idea_4: "Shifting Loyalties"
 VYT_idea_4_desc: "Hlynov was never quite in the sphere of influence of the Grand Prince proper. At many points, Hlynov would shift to working with the Steppe peoples to preserve its independence, as when an alliance was struck with the Khans of Kazan against Muscovy. This diplomatic dynamism is a great strength."
 VYT_idea_5: "Dymkovo Toys"
 VYT_idea_5_desc: "Hlynov's greatest fame in later centuries came from its distinctive clay toys called Dymkovo, which name their name from a village near the city center. The brightly-painted statuettes originated as Pagan idols but eventually lost their cultic significance and came to be produced for children, usually by the city's women."
 VYT_idea_6: "Aleksandr Herzen"
 VYT_idea_6_desc: "In the Russian Imperial period, because of its geographic isolation, Hlynov became a popular destination for government exiles, including the Swedish-born architect Aleksandr Vitberg and the socialist thinker Aleksandr Herzen. Herzen was instrumental in the emancipation of Russian serfs, and his ideas, articulated in books like 'Who is to Blame?', inspired subsequent generations of Russian socialists including Vladimir Lenin."
 VYT_idea_7: "Siberian Transit"
 VYT_idea_7_desc: "It is high time that Russia invested in a rapid travel system across Siberia. Hlynov is ideal as a hub directing travelers from Moscow along the continent to Vladivostok, and in the future may even be suitable to support a trans-continental railway."
#Ingria

 IGR_ideas_start: "Ingrian Traditions"
 IGR_ideas_bonus: "Ingrian Ambition"
 IGR_idea_1: "Ingegerd Olofsdotter"
 IGR_idea_1_desc: "The land of Ingria supposedly takes its name from the Viking princess Ingegerd, daughter of Swedish King Olof Skötkonung af Munsö. When she married Yaroslav the Wise in 1019, she was given the important fort and trade hub of Staraya Ladoga as a gift, and her name became applied to the region and peoples around it."
 IGR_idea_2: "Votes and Izhorians"
 IGR_idea_2_desc: "Ingria is comprised of several distinct ethnic groups, including Votes and Izhorians. The Votes were the first Finnic tribe to settle in the area and were feared by the Russians for their fierce raiding, while the Izhorians migrated to Ingria from Karelia only in the eleventh century. Ingrians proper are further divided into Savakots and Äyrämöisets."
 IGR_idea_3: "Karelian Isthmus"
 IGR_idea_3_desc: "The Karelian Isthmus sits at the mouth of the Baltic Sea and mediates all trade between the inland lakes and rivers and the rest of Europe. We must make use of the fact that this important natural formation borders our homeland and establish trading outposts at Neva."
 IGR_idea_4: "Kylfings"
 IGR_idea_4_desc: "The Kylfings were a group of Scandinavian marauders and mercenaries who served far and wide in the armies of Europe, including those of Hungary and the Byzantine Empire. Their origin has never been determined with certainty, but a popular theory was that they were in fact Ingrian Finns."
 IGR_idea_5: "Sardo"
 IGR_idea_5_desc: "The people of Ingria practice slash-and-burn farming techniques, known in the Ingrian language as 'sardo'. Though this accounted for much of their food, there was also an extensive system of collaborative fishing and livestock rearing. In addition to standard cattle husbandry, horses and geese were also popular in ranches."
 IGR_idea_6: "Slottslän Fleet"
 IGR_idea_6_desc: "In the Swedish era, Ingria was divided into four counties or 'slottslän', each centered around a fortified town - Ivangorod, Jama, Caporie, and Nöteborg. Ingria's towns became important naval hubs for Baltic Sea trade and warfare, with the inland forests being excellent for shipbuilding."
 IGR_idea_7: "Kreevins"
 IGR_idea_7_desc: "When the Teutonic Knights invaded Ingria in 1444, they captured many slaves and brought them back to Livonia to construct castles. The slaves afterward assimilated into the local Latvian populations, forgetting they were ever Ingrians. Nevertheless, we can take advantage of the fact that we have brethren in this neighboring land."
#Karelia
 KRL_ideas: "Karelian Ideas"
 KRL_ideas_start: "Karelian Traditions"
 KRL_ideas_bonus: "Karelian Ambition"
 KRL_idea_1: "Lake Ladoga"
 KRL_idea_1_desc: "The centerpiece of Karelia is Lake Ladoga, named after the fort of Staraya Ladoga on its southern coast. This fort, built in the eighth century, was the first capital of Rurik himself and became one of the most important trade centers in Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages. The whole Varangian trade route connecting Scandinavia to Constantinople and the Far East passed through Ladoga."
 KRL_idea_2: "Veps"
 KRL_idea_2_desc: "In addition to the main population of Karelians, the Veps or Vepsians are another ethnic group that once inhabited a vast area eventually settled by Ilmen Slavs. Vepsian is closely related to Karelian, and surely if we promote mutual contact and communication we can bring our two people even closer together."
 KRL_idea_3: "Novgorodian Connections"
 KRL_idea_3_desc: "In the high Middle Ages, Karelians were feared by even the Vikings for their prowess in raiding and pillaging settlements. Gradually, the Karelians began to cooperate with Novgorod and fall under its dominance. Though this lost us our autonomy and our ancient faith, it provided lucrative trading opportunities that we would have otherwise never had as mere raiders."
 KRL_idea_4: "Legacy of Nöteborg"
 KRL_idea_4_desc: "The treaty of Nöteborg in 1323 partitioned Karelia between the spheres of influence of the Novgorodian Russians and the Swedes. This has left Karelia's identity split between two states, two languages, and two religions. We must enforce our unity and promote a common Karelian identity across the continent, no matter what language is spoken by the ruling class."
 KRL_idea_5: "Two Dueling Arms"
 KRL_idea_5_desc: "As a result of Nöteborg, Karelia even has two separate coats of arms, one under Sweden and one under Russia. The Russian blazon depicts a bear, while the Swedish blazon, first presented at the death of Gustav Vasa in 1560, fittingly depicts 'a crown or above two dueling arms argent, the left gauntleted with a sword and the right mailed with a scimitar'."
 KRL_idea_6: "Kizhi Pogost"
 KRL_idea_6_desc: "Karelia is noted for its unique Russian-style wooden architecture, including multi-levelled domed churches like Kizhi Pogost on the island of Kizhi. The church's eighteenth-century wooden paneling is legendary for its intricacy, and its painted iconostasis brings onlookers to tears through its beauty."
 KRL_idea_7: "Karelianism"
 KRL_idea_7_desc: "Karelianism refers to a cultural movement in the Grand Duchy of Finland while it was attempting to define its identity in the late nineteenth century. Poets, painters, and folklorists viewed Karelian culture as the 'true and original' Finnish culture untainted by outside influence, and the Finnish national epic Kalevala was based off of Karelian legends and traditions."
#Qasim

 QAS_ideas_bonus: "Qasimi Ambition"
 QAS_idea_1: "Meshchera Lowlands"
 QAS_idea_1_desc: "Among the various Volga Finn groups, the Meshchera inhabit the least hospital region short of the Siberian tundra. These so-called Meshchera Lowlands are filled with dense forests punctuated by lakes, swamps, and bogs. An army unfamiliar with the landscape can easily lose itself in the muck, or an unwary scout may be led astray by a will-o'-the-wisp, never to be seen again."
 QAS_idea_2: "Meshchersky"
 QAS_idea_2_desc: "At the turn of the fourteenth century, a dissident named Bakhmet Husein Shirin left the Golden Horde and founded an independent principality on the former lands of the Meshchera called Mishar Yurt. Mishar Turks and Meshchera Finns were integrated seamlessly, and Husein's son Beklemish even converted to Christianity, taking the name Mikhail. Husein was thus the ancestor of a lasting princely family which went on to be called Meshchersky for their rule of Meshchera."
 QAS_idea_3: "Misär"
 QAS_idea_3_desc: "The entire Mishary Turkic culture group comes from the Tatar tribes who settled in Meshchera, gradually corrupting the name to Mishar. The capital city of the Meshchera Finns, originally founded as Gorodets Meshchyorsky, was renamed Misär and finally Qasimov after the Kazani Qasim Khan who founded a new state centered around the city in the middle of the fifteenth century. Qasim Khan's diplomatic maneuvering brought him friends among both the Tatars and Russians."
 QAS_idea_4: "Khan's Mosque"
 QAS_idea_4_desc: "In a sea of Orthodox steeples, Qasimov is noted for its 16th or possibly even 15th-century 'Khan's Mosque' with its distinctive white stone minaret. Though the building was torn down by Peter the Great in 1702, the minimalist minaret continued standing as a testament to Qasim's architectural and artistic eye."
 QAS_idea_5: "Elective Monarchy"
 QAS_idea_5_desc: "The Qasim Khanate was ruled by Khans, but the Russian state ultimately had control over its foreign policy and diplomatic affairs. The Russians nominated a Khan from among the noblest Tatar families, including the Manghut, Argin, Jalair, and Kipchak. Several of these families had ruled significant empires in the past."
 QAS_idea_6: "Fatima Soltan"
 QAS_idea_6_desc: "The later Khans of Qasim had several prominent roles, including Simeon Bekbulatovich who was briefly crowned Grand Prince of the Rus. It was the final Khatun, Fatima Soltan, who had perhaps the most fortune, leading a diplomatic resistance against the forces of Christianization that were being thrust upon the realm by its Russian overlords. Though she was ultimately unsuccessful, her fighting spirit lives on in Qasimov."
 QAS_idea_7: "Qasimov Waiters"
 QAS_idea_7_desc: "In the 1800s Qasimov became famous for an unexpected resource - its wait staff. Waiters from Qasimov were considered among the finest in the Russian Empire and were brought to the capital city Saint Petersburg to work in its hotels and restaurants."

 TBI_idea_1: "Emirate of Tiflis"
 TBI_idea_1_desc: "The Emirate of Tiflis was founded by Caliph Marwan II in 736 after defeating the local Georgians and establishing a local Islamic powerbase. For centuries the Emirate was one of the northernmost outposts of Caliphal power, and was ruled by the Shuabid dynasty until it was supplanted by the Shaybanids and Jaffarids."
 TBI_idea_2: "Sahak"
 TBI_idea_2_desc: "Sahak, or Ishaq ibn Ismail ibn Shuab, was the greatest Emir of Tiflis in the early middle ages. The Emirate reached its peak under his rule with tribute being extracted from almost all the neighboring kingdoms, but when Sahak tried to revolt against the Abbasids in 853 in alliance with his local tributaries, the Caliph's enforcer Bugha the Turk cooperated with the Georgian Bagratids to defeat and kill Sahak. Tbilisi itself was sacked and burned to the ground, though our dynasty has rebuilt the city over the centuries, honoring Sahak's vision of freedom."
 TBI_idea_3: "Tbileli Berebi"
 TBI_idea_3_desc: "After the extinction of the line of the Emirs of Tiflis, the city was ruled by a merchant oligarchy called the Tbileli Berebi. These Elders ensured Tbilisi's status as the second greatest trading hub of the Caucasus after Derbent."
 TBI_idea_4: "Abo of Tiflis"
 TBI_idea_4_desc: "Tbilisi is the home city of one notable martyr, Saint Abo. Abu al-Taflisi was an Arab Muslim who moved to Tiflis to work as a perfumer, and converted to Christianity after much theological debate. After a trip to Khazaria he returned to Tiflis with newfound zeal and attempted to convert other Muslims, leading him to be denounced as an apostate and executed."
 TBI_idea_5: "Shuris-tsikhe"
 TBI_idea_5_desc: "Stretching across an imposing hill by the Mtkvari River, Shuris-tsikhe Fortress was adapted from an original late antique Sasanian structure. In the Mongol era, it was renamed Narin Qala, which eventually became Narikala. Regardless of the name, it is a vital defensive installment for the city."
 TBI_idea_6: "Renovate Sioni Cathedral"
 TBI_idea_6_desc: "The greatest Christian religious building in Tbilisi is Sioni Cathedral, first built as a church in the fifth century by King Vakhtang Gorgasali. Though it was demolished and rebuilt by the Arabs, the grand stone structure and in particular the central dome have declined over the centuries. We must renovate the church and make it fitting of the greatest Caucasian city."
 TBI_idea_7: "Ilia Chavchavadze"
 TBI_idea_7_desc: "Tbilisi became the center of the Georgian national revival in the nineteenth century, with many important figures calling it home. The poet and national hero Ilia Chavchavadze is one such intellectual who had a profound effect on the promotion of Georgian language, culture, and literature in the face of Russian imperialism. Ilia was so lionized by the Georgian people that he was canonized a Saint and was referred to with the epithet 'Ugvirgvino Mepe', 'Uncrowned King'."

 russian_ducal_idea_1_desc: "All Princely lines of the Kievan Rus are ultimately descended from the Viking Hrøríkr, who conquered Novgorod in the ninth century. He was known to the local Slavs as Rurik, and the state of his sons was gradually partitioned more and more according to local customs until there were dozens of states all ruled by Rurikovich cadet branches."
 russian_ducal_idea_2: "Russkaya Pravda"
 russian_ducal_idea_2_desc: "The 'Russian Law' of Yaroslav the Wise is the basic legal text for all Russian states. Its original form was established by the great statesman and leader in the eleventh century, but it was revised in subsequent eras to suit the changing needs of the Russian people. Unlike other legal systems in Europe, it was not based on the Roman laws of Justinian but modeled after Norse customs which forbade capital punishment."
 russian_ducal_idea_3: "Reform the Rota"
 russian_ducal_idea_3_desc: "Another innovation of Yaroslav the Wise that had a lasting effect on the Russian Principalities was his introduction of a Rota system. According to this eccentric succession method, Princes would have their lands inherited by their fourth brother with a ladder of importance leading up to the Grand Princely title. This system has caused much infighting and confusion, and could serve to be reformed with more straightforward juridical guidelines."
 russian_ducal_idea_4: "Dnieper Trade"
 russian_ducal_idea_4_desc: "The Russian lands are intersected by many twining rivers including the Don, Oka, Dniestr, Volga, Dnieper, and Daugava. The Dnieper is the greatest of these rivers, and the original Rus capital at Kiev sits on its shore. Like our Varangian ancestors, the Russians make use of these rivers for travel purposes to trade and conduct warfare."
 russian_ducal_idea_5: "Oprichnina"
 russian_ducal_idea_5_desc: "Ivan the Terrible, Tsar of All Rus, famously conducted a policy of expansion against the nobility called the Oprichnina. The name itself comes for a special type of land owned directly by the head of state. We should promote the royal Oprichnina ourselves and crack down on the rebellious boyars who threaten our power."
 russian_ducal_idea_6: "Russian Orthodoxy"
 russian_ducal_idea_6_desc: "Since Vladimir the Great famously converted to Orthodox Christianity in the tenth century after his legates travelled to Constantinople and saw the wonder of Hagia Sophia, Orthodoxy had been a core element of Russian identity. Over time, Russia became the center of the Orthodox world and achieved autocephalous status. We must preserve our heritage and promote the Russian Orthodox Church at all costs."
 russian_ducal_idea_7: "Serfdom"
 russian_ducal_idea_7_desc: "Serfs existed in Russia for much longer than they did in the rest of Europe. Though agitators for liberty like Yemelyan Pugachev tried to grant the serfs more rights, they nevertheless stood as an agricultural labor force well into the modern era. Those who did eventually achieve freedom often stayed in the same business as kulaks."

In ancient times, all the various tribes lived around the Ural Mountains before gradually migrating to other parts of Europe. The harsh living made our ancestors hardy, and just like the Magyars we too can be the scourge of Europe!"
 volgaic_idea_2: "Keremets"
 volgaic_idea_2_desc: "According to Mari mythology, Keremet are a race of half-man demigods that walk the earth. Chumbylat, the great Mari leader of the twelfth century who united the various Mari peoples under one banner and established a new religious orthodoxy, was considered a Keremet in posterity. Chumbylat filled his land with forts to protect the Volgaic tribes and honored the sacred groves of our ancestors."
 volgaic_idea_3: "Great Perm"
 volgaic_idea_3_desc: "The city of Great Perm was the center of the most advanced and prestigious Volga Finnic state, the Principality of Perm. Under the overlordship of the Novgorodians and later Muscovites, the Principality became a cornerstone of European fur trade through its Kolva River access."
 volgaic_idea_4: "Dorvyzhy"
 volgaic_idea_4_desc: "The national epic of the Udmurts is called the Dorvyzhy, or 'Homeland Generation'. It consists of ten Cantos based on various local oral traditions recounting the deeds of the Udmurt heroes and their gods Inmar, Kuaz, and Kyldysin."
 volgaic_idea_5: "Stephen of Perm"
 volgaic_idea_5_desc: "In the late fourteenth century, Saint Stephen of Perm was responsible for the Orthodox mission that converted many of the Volga Peoples from their pagan ways. Stephen was also responsible for creating a writing system for the Komi language, known as Old Permic Script."
 volgaic_idea_6: "Mastorava"
 volgaic_idea_6_desc: "Just as the Udmurts have the Dorvyzhy, the Mordvins have the Mastorava, a compendium of Mordvinic folklore and mythology.

 volgaic_idea_7: "Volga"
 volgaic_idea_7_desc: "The Volga Finns broadly derive their name from the nearby Volga river, one of the most imposing rivers of Eastern Europe. At the corner of this river is the fortress of Sary-Su, which would go on to be called Tsaritsyn under the Russians. This river and the fort that guards it stands as the gateway between Europe and Central Asia."

 RVE_idea_2: "Complications of Italian Politics"
 RVE_idea_2_desc: "The political fragmentation of the Italian Peninsula as well as the creation of various factions such as the Guelphs and Ghibellines forces us to be keen on Italian politics and to be masterful at diplomacy.

 eastfrisian_idea_1_desc: "The East Frisians controlled the mouth of the Ems river and threatened the ships coming down the river. Moreover, the East Frisian chieftains used to provide shelter for pirates such as the famous Klaus Störtebeker and Goedeke Michel, who were a threat to the ships of the powerful Hanseatic League which they attacked and robbed."
 eastfrisian_idea_2: "Marshes of East Frisia"
 eastfrisian_idea_2_desc: "In the early Middle Ages, because of numerous North Sea floods, East Frisians could only settle on the higher situated Geest areas. Later, by erecting Warften, East Frisians also settled in the marshes. Although quite inhospitable, the marshes also provided protection for the East Frisians. Thanks to the swampy terrain, East Frisian peasants defeated invading armies again and again, despite having a numerical disadvantage."
 eastfrisian_idea_3: "The Redjeven"
 eastfrisian_idea_3_desc: "In the 12th century, Frisia was characterized by the Frisian Freedom. This freedom was represented abroad by the Redjeven, who were elected from among the wealthier farmers or elected representatives of the autonomous peasant republics. Originally the Redjeven were all judges, so-called Asega, who were appointed by the territorial lords."
 eastfrisian_idea_4: "East Frisian Chieftains"
 eastfrisian_idea_4_desc: "Frisian autonomy could only survive under chieftains, a self-proclaimed nobility. While this ended in centuries-long feuds in Friesland and Groningen, a family of counts developed in East Friesland that brought the entire area under its control."
 eastfrisian_idea_5: "Ostfriesische Landschaft"
 eastfrisian_idea_5_desc: "With the elevation of East Frisia to imperial county, the Emperor assured the East Frisians that all the rights and freedoms they have had since time immemorial should continue to be valid. This is the origin of the Ostfriesische Landschaft, a representative body of three estates, but instead of a clergy estate, a completely equal peasant estate. The Ostfreeske Landschaft received sovereignty in legislation, tax collection and case law. As a result, sovereignty lay primarily with the Landschaft, rather than with the monarch."
 eastfrisian_idea_6: "Upstalsboom League"
 eastfrisian_idea_6_desc: "In order to provide a systematic legal system for the autonomous Frisian lands, local leaders attempted to agree and apply rules to the entire region of Frisia. Legal and political delegates from various provinces came to meetings at the Opstalboom in the East Frisian city of Aurich, to judge, to make decisions and, if necessary, to defend their autonomy. The delegates were elected by their home province at Easter and together were called to a jury. The meetings took place once a year on the Tuesday after Pentecost."
 eastfrisian_idea_7: "The Concordat of Emden"
 eastfrisian_idea_7_desc: "The East Frisian city of Emden was a popular destination for Calvinists fleeing from religious persecution in the Low Countries, greatly influencing the religious fabric of East Frisia. In Rheiderland, Emsigerland and Federgo, Calvinism became the dominant church. The other provinces and the count, however, were Lutheran. The Concordat of Emden in 1599 set rules for the cooperation of Lutherans and Calvinists in East Frisia."

 RMI_idea_1_desc: "Under Byzantine rule, Rimini helped form and became the seat of the Duchy of the Pentapolis, consisting of the cities of Pesaro, Fano, Senigallia and Ancona. Each of them grew wealthy from trade and became considerably autonomous from their Byzantine rulers. The Pentapolis left behind a legacy of maritime might, the promotion of trade, and independence, which Rimini shall proudly uphold."
 RMI_idea_2: "The Ascent of the Malatesta"
 RMI_idea_2_desc: "Rimini had some importance during the Middle Ages as a commercial hub on the Adriatic, yet at the same time it was subjected to the Archbishops of Ravenna, limiting its freedom and development. This changed in the 12th century when Rimini became independent. In the ensuing factional conflicts throughout Italy, Rimini aligned with the pro-Papal Guelphs. The aftermath of the conflict led to the rise of the Malatesta family, who shaped Rimini politically for centuries."
 RMI_idea_3: "Carlo I and Condottieri"
 RMI_idea_3_desc: "Carlo I Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, was not only known for his political and diplomatic skills, but also his status as a captain of fortune. As a result, condottieri had a profound impact on Riminesi history. The following rulers of Rimini, most notably Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, often rented out condottieri to various Italian states. Riminesi condottieri were very sought after and fought for various Italian powerhouses such as Venice, Milan, and the Papal States, bringing income and prestige to the city."
 RMI_idea_4: "Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta"
 RMI_idea_4_desc: "The Lord of Rimini in the early 15th century, Sigismondo Pandolfo not only participated in various wars but was also a patron of the arts, hiring the most prestigious artists in Italy. Malatesta’s promotion of the arts was central to his need of funds, forcing him into conflict with other Italian states to cover those expenses. He was ambitious and in his lifetime warred against Urbino, Milan, Naples and the Pope, enlarging his possessions in Romagna and Marche. Fighting for the Venetians, he even saw action against the Ottomans in Morea."
 RMI_idea_5: "Rinascimento Riminesi"
 RMI_idea_5_desc: "The Malatesta family patronized many cultural projects during the early Renaissance. As part of the Rinascimento Riminesi, the Malatesta Library was built in Cesena, and was the first civic library in all of Italy, open to all citizens and containing works of philosophy, theology, and science. Artists such as Leon Battista Alberti and Piero della Francesca worked on projects in Rimini, and later, Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta rebuilt the Church of San Francesco under the direction of Agostino di Duccio."
 RMI_idea_6: "Plaza del Comune"
 RMI_idea_6_desc: "Starting in the 12th century, the Plaza del Comune became the center of civil power in Rimini. The plaza housed the Palazzo dell’Arrengo, Palazzo del Podestà, the market, as well as medieval traditions such as equestrian tournaments. While small in size, through its importance for the fostering of Riminesi culture, the plaza is integral to Rimini as a whole."
 RMI_idea_7: "Solidify Papal Relations"
 RMI_idea_7_desc: "Rimini was thrust into a predicament mainly as a result of the Italian Wars. When the Duke of Urbino, Cesare Borgia, seized the lands of the lords of Romagna, the absorption of Rimini to either the Papal States or France seemed inevitable. Even though we have a rich military background, diplomacy may be a better and safer option. If Rimini can balance proving its worth as an independent commune to its potentially hostile neighbors, it will be possible to escape any precarious situation."

 MTZ_idea_4: "Crossroads of Cultures"
 MTZ_idea_4_desc: "As a result of its location on the Moselle and near the border between the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire, Metz was at the crossroads of many different cultures and languages including both Romance and Germanic. The people of Metz should be inclusive of all its citizens, even those of other cultures, for the benefit of the city."
 MTZ_idea_5: "The Maid and the Unviolated"
 MTZ_idea_5_desc: "Although its location between France and Germany gave Metz special importance within the Holy Roman Empire, it also became a key weakness of the city as it attracted many foreign invasions seeking to control the important and strategic garrison city. Armies of England, France, Lorraine, Provence, Trier and Luxemburg all tried but to no avail to invade Metz. We shall stand firm and preserve our independence and autonomy."
 MTZ_idea_6: "Les Trois-Évêchés"
 MTZ_idea_6_desc: "Under the Treaty of Chambord in 1522, Metz, along with Toul and Verdun, passed to the control of the French monarchy. The cities, all former Prince-Bishoprics and Free Imperial Cities, became governed together in an entity known as the Three Bishoprics, or les Trois-Évêchés. Imperial forces tried to recover its former possessions in the Siege of Metz in 1552 and 1553 but failed. Metz became the center and capital of the Three Bishoprics and prospered in the following centuries under French rule."
 MTZ_idea_7: "The Heart of Lorraine"

 malaspina_idea_4_desc: "Dante Alighieri condemns a staggering amount of medieval Italian figures over the course of his famous Divine Comedy. The Malaspina are one of the few families he praises, due to his friendship with Moroello Malaspina, who hosted him in Lunigiana several times and even had him broker a peace deal in 1306. Dante's kind words are in the eighth canto of Purgatorio, where he says, 'Where throughout all Europe dwelleth a man who knows them not?'."
 malaspina_idea_5: "Spino Secco and Spino Fiorito"
 malaspina_idea_5_desc: "One of the most notable features of the Malaspina family was the degree to which their lands fragmented to increasingly small titles over the course of the Middle Ages. The most basic division was that between the Spino Secco branch, who largely held possessions north of Genoa, and the Spino Fiorito branch, who largely held possessions in Lunigiana."
 malaspina_idea_6: "Lunigiana"
 malaspina_idea_6_desc: "Tucked between the Appenines and the riviera of Liguria, the Lunigiana is a hilly and isolated region named for the ancient Roman city of Luni. Despite its small confines, numerous castles were built by the various Malaspina branches that resided there, making it difficult to cross or invade for hostile forces."
 malaspina_idea_7: "Massa and Carrara"
 malaspina_idea_7_desc: "The Duchy of Massa and Carrara, established in the fifteenth century, went on to become one of the few titles in all Italy that survived up to the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, when it was finally combined with Lucca to form a duchy for Napoleon's sister Elisa."

 marchigian_ideas_start: "Marchigian Traditions"
 marchigian_ideas_bonus: "Marchigian Ambition"
 marchigian_idea_1: "Ducato di Fermo"
 marchigian_idea_1_desc: "The original March of Fermo was formed out of the older Duchy of Fermo established by the Lombard King Luitprand in 727. A sole Duke, Tasbuno, is recorded from this early period. While the Duchy is thus shrouded in mystery, its existence proves the ancient rights and prestige of the Marches."
 marchigian_idea_2: "Land of Marches"
 marchigian_idea_2_desc: "The Marche region of Italy gets its name from the various medieval margraviates established by the Holy Roman Emperor and Pope. These included the March of Camerino, the March of Fermo, and the March of Ancona, essentially covering the entire coastline of the Duchy of Spoleto through to the south of Abruzzo. This web of marches was usually united with the Spoletini Duchy, but in the middle of the eleventh century they gained their first independent margrave, the German adventurer Werner von Urslingen."
 marchigian_idea_3: "Markward von Annweiler"
 marchigian_idea_3_desc: "The last medieval Margrave of Fermo and Ancona was the imperial ministerialis Markward von Annweiler, known to the locals as Marcovaldo di Annweiler. As a loyal servant of Emperor Heinrich VI, Markward was granted many prestigious positions in Italy and became the linchpin of the local imperial administration. He eventually ended up as regent of the entire Kingdom of Sicily, finally allowing the Marche to be returned to Papal control under the diplomacy of the legendary Pope Innocent III."
 marchigian_idea_4: "Constitutiones Aegidianae"
 marchigian_idea_4_desc: "The fourteenth-century Constitutiones Sanctae Matris Ecclesiae, also known as the Constitutiones Aegidianae, was the primary constitution of the Papal States throughout the early modern period and in particular re-organized the Marche as a singular province under the control of a Papal rector."
 marchigian_idea_5: "Fraticelli"
 marchigian_idea_5_desc: "After the Franciscans split into their Conventual and Spiritual branches, the radical Spirituals spread throughout Italy from the area around Assisi. These 'Fraticelli', persecuted vigorously by Catholic authorities, came to see the Marche as their homeland and main base of operations, with the fragmented local power structure allowing them protection. Even in the mid fifteenth century when the movement had been virtually erased, there were still Fraticelli communes in the Jesi valley region."
 marchigian_idea_6: "Sforza's Legacy"
 marchigian_idea_6_desc: "After the fragmentation of the Marca Anconitana and Marca Fermana into various city-states, the greatest restorer of unity in the Marche was Francesco Sforza, the Romagnan condottieri who would go on to found the Sforza dynasty of Milan. Sforza went from city to city demanding their submission and for the first time in centuries turned the Marche into a united power, much to the relief of the locals who had suffered constant war and Papal interference. When Sforza left the marches, ironically, they were finally brought under full Papal control."
 marchigian_idea_7: "Shoemaking"
 marchigian_idea_7_desc: "In the Middle Ages, the Marche was an agricultural region, producing grains, olives, wine, truffle, and more. Nevertheless, urban areas were always involved in craftmaking, and in the modern era this evolved into a rich tradition of leatherworking and shoe production."
#Luxeuil
 LXU_ideas: "Luxeuilois Ideas"
 LXU_ideas_start: "Luxeuilois Traditions"
 LXU_ideas_bonus: "Luxeuilois Ambition"
 LXU_idea_1: "Columbanian Foundation"
 LXU_idea_1_desc: "Luxeuil is the greatest of the many monastic foundations by the acclaimed Irish missionary Saint Columbanus. Columbanus found a Roman ruin, overgrown with trees and littered with Pagan idols, and after receiving a grant from the Frankish King Childebert transformed it into an abbey that would go on to become the pride of Gaul and one of the finest in the entire European continent."
 LXU_idea_2: "Luxeuil Minuscule"
 LXU_idea_2_desc: "On top of its fame as a center of monastic life, Luxeuil Abbey was also well-known for its prestigious scriptorium and the unique variant on Merovingian minuscule script which developed there. This flowing cursive hand was known as 'Luxeuil minuscule' and can be identified by its signature open-topped a's."
 LXU_idea_3: "Recover From the Saracens"
 LXU_idea_3_desc: "The Andalusian leader Abdul Rahman al-Ghafiqi, who famously died at the Battle of Tours against Charles Martel in 732 AD, managed to sack Luxeuil Abbey before his crushing defeat. Almost all of the monks were massacred and the scriptorium was destroyed, never to be active again. The abbey would later be raided by Vikings and Magyars as well. It is high time we invested in a full recovery from this disaster and rebuild the scriptorium bigger and better than ever."
 LXU_idea_4: "Saint-Pierre et Saint-Paul"
 LXU_idea_4_desc: "The abbey at Luxeuil is dedicated to both Saint Peter and Saint Paul, some of the most important figures in early Christianity. Its first abbot after Columbanus, Eustace, also would become a cherished local Saint due to his piety and effective governance of the abbey."
 LXU_idea_5: "Thermal Baths"
 LXU_idea_5_desc: "One of the reasons why Saint Columbanus was attracted to the site of Luxovium was the ancient thermal baths which were present in the area. These warm, mineral-rich springs are important for the economy of the city and are referenced in its full French name, Luxeuil-les-Bains."
 LXU_idea_6: "Commission des Réguliers"
 LXU_idea_6_desc: "In the early modern era, discipline at Luxeuil Abbey declined precipitously as the practice of keeping resident abbots was replaced with that of non-resident commendatory abbots, who essentially held the title as a meaningless sinecure. To fight this decline, the abbey was finally annexed to the Congregation of Saint-Vanne, and by 1768 an audit of Regulars found the monastery to be flourishing again."
 LXU_idea_7: "Dentelle de Luxeuil"
 LXU_idea_7_desc: "While its thermal baths were known throughout France, Luxeuil's lace industry would also gradually take on an important role in its economy. The so-called 'Dentelle de Luxeuil', characterized by lace sown onto underlying fabric, was a sign of luxury and wealth in post-revolutionary France."

 XCL_idea_1: "Anscarids"
 XCL_idea_1_desc: "The house of Chalon-Arlay is a cadet branch of the house of Ivrea, which in turn developed from the Frankish Anscarids. Anscar of Ivrea was granted land in Italy in the late ninth century after venturing there from his homeland in Bavaria, and his scions would go on to spread across Europe, holding titles as prestigious as King of Spain and Stadtholder of the Netherlands."
 XCL_idea_2: "Petite Guerre de Chalon"
 XCL_idea_2_desc: "In 1273, King Edward of England had a jousting tournament against Count Pierre of Chalon which became so intense it was given the moniker 'Petite Guerre de Chalon', the 'Little War of Chalon'. Pierre attempted to grab Edward by the neck to unseat him, but Edward's retinue broke onto the field and mobbed Pierre, starting a violent brawl in which several participants died. Though Pierre may have lost the fight, we should be proud that our ancestor faced off against a king."
 XCL_idea_3: "Salt Road"
 XCL_idea_3_desc: "In antiquity, our locale came to prominence as a station on the salt road that brought the fruits of the great saltworks of Salins across the river Seille to the rest of Europe. This economic role did not die with the Roman Empire, as the medieval counts were still vital to the distribution of salt, having the ability to halt its passage if they so desired."
 XCL_idea_4: "Gateway to Germany"
 XCL_idea_4_desc: "The Juras region marks the borderland between the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire, and was thus of great strategic importance, with many local fortresses being built to command access to each state. These strongholds were upgraded and maintained by subsequent monarchs all the way through to the early modern era."
 XCL_idea_5: "Jura Vineyards"
 XCL_idea_5_desc: "Local vineyards are some of the oldest continually-worked vineyards in all France, producing wine under a label that commands prestige everywhere. Many hectares of land surrounding the medieval castles are used to plant and cultivate grapes for this legendary wine."
 XCL_idea_6: "Division of Auxerre"
 XCL_idea_6_desc: "The local nobility in the Burgundy region often traded their land around, and one of the most fortunate breaks for the house of Chalon-Arlay was the Sixth Division of Auxerre, in which many baronies held by our bankrupt cousins were redistributed to us, giving us a patchwork of fiefs across Franche-Comté."
 XCL_idea_7: "Gueules à la Bande d'Or"
 XCL_idea_7_desc: "The coat of arms of the Chalon-Arlay counts consists of a red field with a golden band diagonally crossing it. When Arlay was inherited in the thirteenth century, a blue star was added to the band to distinguish the new line from the original line, and after inheriting the Principality of Orange the arms were modified further with the blue horn of Orange."

 BOB_idea_1: "Saint Columbanus"
 BOB_idea_1_desc: "One of the greatest early medieval missionary-saints was Columbanus, an Irishman who travelled throughout the Frankish Empire in the sixth and seventh centuries founding abbeys. Many of these abbeys, like Luxeuil, would go on to become Europe's finest. Columbanus graced Bobbio with his presence during his travels and sure enough founded a local monastery that became the pride of all Italy. To this day, its official name is 'Abbazia di San Colombano'."
 BOB_idea_2: "Bobbio Scriptorium"
 BOB_idea_2_desc: "The prestige of Columbanus' abbey at Bobbio only increased as the Middle Ages went on, particularly as the abbey became a bastion of Catholic theological resistance against Arianism. Bobbio Abbey amassed a library of immense value and housed a monastic scriptorium that produced high-quality manuscripts coveted throughout the continent. Due to these institutions of learning, Bobbio remained a center for culture and knowledge in Northern Italy for many centuries, and its scriptorium was the largest book producer in Italy."
 BOB_idea_3: "Bobbio Monastic Fief"
 BOB_idea_3_desc: "Not only was Bobbio Abbey a seat of culture and learning, it was a seat of great political power as well. When Abbot Pietroaldo was named Count-Bishop in 1014, the abbacy began to amass an enormous series of feudal possessions all across Lombardy and Piedmont."
 BOB_idea_4: "Dal Verme"
 BOB_idea_4_desc: "After the decline of Bobbio Abbey, its feudal title was taken over first by the Malaspina family and then the Dal Verme family, who ruled it for centuries. These Lombard nobles were loyal servants of the Dukes of Milan and often worked as condottieri while reaping the rewards of their comital title, eventually becoming marquises."
 BOB_idea_5: "The Mona Lisa"
 BOB_idea_5_desc: "Leonardo da Vinci immortalized Bobbio by finishing his legendary painting of Mona Lisa in its vicinity, using the local landscape to fill out the background. Bobbio is thus present in the most famous painting in world history."
 BOB_idea_6: "Saltworks"
 BOB_idea_6_desc: "A series of thermal springs near Bobbio provide warm and mineral-rich water to its inhabitants year round. Even in the Lombard age, the springs were exploited for their salt content, particularly by the local Lombard lord Sundrarit. In the early modern era, the healing quality of the minerals began to be better appreciated and the springs were turned into thermal baths."
 BOB_idea_7: "Val Trebbia"
 BOB_idea_7_desc: "Bobbio sits at the entrance to the Trebbia Valley at the foot of Mount Penice, in what the American writer Ernest Hemingway would describe as 'the most beautiful place in the world'. This Apennine valley is the gateway between Liguria and Emilia, commanding an important trade route."

 XMC_idea_1: "Chancery of Cluny"
 XMC_idea_1_desc: "From 927 to 1157, the Abbey of Cluny was ruled by five influential abbots who were both friends and advisors to emperors, kings, princes and popes. This was the foundation of the unique status of the abbey, which was directly subordinate to the pope. Many other monasteries asked the abbots of Cluny for advice and joined him. Affiliation to Cluny yielded privileges and esteem."
 XMC_idea_2: "Bridge to Savoy"
 XMC_idea_2_desc: "During the Middle Ages, Mâcon was the administrative center of a county belonging to the Duchy of Burgundy at the extremity of the bridge over the Saône leading to the Bresse territory belonging to the Duchy of Savoy. The town was controlling access to present-day Lamartinien Valley (Val Lamartinien), where the southern end of the Côte de Bourgogne joins the first foothills of the Beaujolais hills, opening the way to the rich plains of the Loire."
 XMC_idea_3: "Superlative Architecture"
 XMC_idea_3_desc: "The Abbey of Cluny, for more than three centuries the largest church in Christendom, was the architects' passion turned to stone to create something unique in honour of God. It was a high point in Romanesque art and already heralded the transition to Gothic. The architects surpassed everything that was standard at the time."
 XMC_idea_4: "Monastic Empire"
 XMC_idea_4_desc: "The second abbot of Cluny, Saint Odo, took advantage of the abbey's special legal status and united several monasteries under his authority. Cluny reached its membership peak at the beginning of the 12th century with about 400 monks. Later, around 1200, a total of about 1,500 subsidiaries in Italy, Spain, England, Germany, Poland and the Holy Land were established."
 XMC_idea_5: "Heart of Burgundy"
 XMC_idea_5_desc: "Mâcon is located in the center of Burgundy and represents the heart of the region. This allows us extensive diplomatic possibilities and opportunities."
 XMC_idea_6: "Mercenary Stronghold"
 XMC_idea_6_desc: "During the French Wars of Religion, mercenaries from Germany and Switzerland regularly settled in Mâcon. We should hire them and send them against our enemies."
 XMC_idea_7: "Militant Catholicism"
 XMC_idea_7_desc: "With Pope Urban II, who proclaimed the First Crusade in 1095, the Abbey of Cluny produced at least one pope who was particularly brilliant but also militant. The monastery became the most important pillar of the Crusade idea in the East and the Reconquista in Spain."

 altSAX_idea_1_desc: "The dominion of the Dukes of Saxony was truly expansive. At times, it stretched from the northern reaches of the Holy Roman Empire to its south in Italy, as well as the territories in between such as Bavaria. Henry the Proud, whose domain included Saxony, Tuscany, and Spoleto, boasted that his realm stretched 'from sea to sea, from Denmark to Sicily'."
 altSAX_idea_2: "Reunite the Stem Duchy"
 altSAX_idea_2_desc: "The once expansive lands of the Stem Duchy of Saxony have been slipping from Saxon hands. Before expanding elsewhere, the lands of the stem duchy, which we have a rightful claim to, must first return under our control and become consolidated."
 altSAX_idea_3: "Lead the Ostsiedlung"
 altSAX_idea_3_desc: "Located on the border of the Holy Roman Empire, Saxony is geographically most suited to lead the Wendish Crusade and propagate the German language and Catholicism to the Pagan Slavs in the Wendland, which is an area ripe for Germanic expansion."
 altSAX_idea_4: "The Saxon Marches"
 altSAX_idea_4_desc: "Following the Wendish Crusade and the capturing of the Pagan Slavic lands, we should divide the territories we conquered in Marca Geronis, which will allow for better administration. The Saxons should also found cities in the region, following the example of Lübeck which Henry the Lion founded."
 altSAX_idea_5: "Braunschweiger Löwe"
 altSAX_idea_5_desc: "The Brunswick Lion, which stood in the Burgplatz square in front of Dankwarderode Castle and Brunswick Cathedral in the city of Brunswick, was erected in the centre of the castle complex as seigniorial symbol of his ducal authority and jurisdiction, probably also as an expression of Henry's claim to power towards the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa. We shall remain independent of foreign interests!"
 altSAX_idea_6: "Kaiserpfalz Goslar"

 BDK_idea_2: "Lords by the Northern Sea"
 BDK_idea_2_desc: "Threats Bederkesa has a plenty. Wild Danes and Frisians come from the sea, raiding and plundering, while allegedly more civilised burghers and bishops of Bremen and Hamburg seek to expand their holdings. If our lordship is to survive, we have to expand beyond our allodial domain."
 BDK_idea_3: "Episcopal Elopement"

 BDK_idea_4: "Embrace Raubritter Identity"
 BDK_idea_4_desc: "Frisians, Danes, peasants, bishops, burghers – everybody around steals, so why shouldn’t we? There is no more efficient way to develop our barren estates than a good dose of brigandage. Our knights extort enough from richer neighbours to be content with their lot."
 BDK_idea_5: "Take Control of the Estuaries"
 BDK_idea_5_desc: "Our land is nestled between the Weser and Elbe estuaries. If we were to intercept both Bremener and Hamburger trade routes, we could dictate the terms on which our states would coexist. To achieve that, we need a substantial fleet."
 BDK_idea_6: "Jaegers"

 VBK_idea_2: "Starostvo"
 VBK_idea_2_desc: "Starostvo, or the rule of elders, is an ancient principle for many civilizations, and among our people it also has been developed for ages. But what if we try to merge it with more modern ideas and let the local elders be heads of their territory? They would have more support and keep doing what is needed from them, or we will find another more loyal elder."

 MSK_idea_2_desc: "At the battle of the river Nemiga in 1067 our glorious warriors showed their strength against foreign invaders.

 MSK_idea_5: "Years of Peace"
 MSK_idea_5_desc: "For more than 100 years Minsk was able to take its time to develop, while our brothers and neighbours fought in constant wars. Since 1167 until the early 1300s neither the hordes nor the Lithuanians bothered us. Such time cannot be wasted and must be used to develop our realm."
 MSK_idea_6: "Interchanged Dynasties"

 BTY_idea_2: "Border Fortress"
 BTY_idea_2_desc: "Since the 11th century, the fort of Brest was a key defense on the edge of 3 borders: Kievan Rus, Lithuania and Poland. Even though it changed its status through the years, the defense provided by the fortress to the nearby area remained the same."
 BTY_idea_3: "Defending the Faith"
 BTY_idea_3_desc: "The Order of Dobrzyn, created by Mazovian rulers to oppose the Teutons, threatened and conquered parts of our state in the early 13th century. Our brothers in faith were under heretic rule, yet our united tactics and forces managed to overcome them. Still, we need to be more careful about them and be ready to defend our faith not only in speeches, but with a sword."
 BTY_idea_4: "Church Keep"
 BTY_idea_4_desc: "Keeping the main city of our realm safe is a way to preserve our independence, and keeps are the best modern defensive structures. Yet having it just for the sake of safety is not enough, and turning one into Saint Peter's Church in 1276 allowed us to kill two birds with one stone."
 BTY_idea_5: "Joint Rule"
 BTY_idea_5_desc: "In 1390 under Lithuanian rule, Brest had a joint rule of two Burgomasters, one to represent the Orthodox community and the other for Catholics. Such a division remained for a decent amount of time."
 BTY_idea_6: "Women's Rule"
 BTY_idea_6_desc: "In the 15th century, Brest was already heavily integrated into the Lithuanian land, yet another duchy partitioned from Berestye, Kobryn, remained with some privileges. Feodora and Anna ruled them for more than 26 years, keeping them out of major news and events."

 PNK_idea_2_desc: "The first thing written about Pinsk was the order to establish a bishopric in the city in 1097 as the population of it grew and needed more than simple church fathers to guide them in the faith. The much-needed structure served us well, and helped us in the hardest times."
 PNK_idea_3: "Balancing the Power"
 PNK_idea_3_desc: "Yaroslav and Yaropolk were two Pinsk dukes, who believed in the idea of balancing the power within the Rus. As Andrey Bogolyubsky gained power and tried to reform his domain, the two Pinsk dukes entered the coalition against him in 1174, even though he wasn't a threat to their lands. Following their ideas, we may stabilize the situation across our borders."
 PNK_idea_4: "Luxurious Celebrations"
 PNK_idea_4_desc: "In 1204 the Hypatian Codex mentions the famous wedding of Vladimir, the son of Pinsk's Kniaz, where a lot of the Rus nobility gathered. To organise such luxurious events is not easy, but for us, it is a way to be respected among our neighbours."
 PNK_idea_5: "Road Network"
 PNK_idea_5_desc: "Trading through rivers is a common practice, but what should a country do if they lack such possibilities? With the development of our road network we may stand against foreign traders and have our goods spread to the world. But all ideas come with risk, as the better roads you have, the more states may want to use them for their ambitions."
 PNK_idea_6: "Franciscan Order"
 PNK_idea_6_desc: "In 1396 the Order of Franciscans appeared in Pinsk. Their presence established communications between Pinsk and Western Europeans, borrowing ideas and allowing more such religious movements to exist on its land."

 TUV_idea_6: "Administrative Divisions"
 TUV_idea_6_desc: "As Turov grew to be a bigger realm the need for subdivisions also increased. In the 11-12th centuries, Turov was split in five regions, which formed a state: Turov, Pinsk, Gorodets, Dubrovitsa and Chertoriysk.

 KRH_idea_1: "Old Karachev"
 KRH_idea_1_desc: "Karachev's name changed over time, yet it still contains the idea behind it. Coming from the words bark and root, it shows the difficult terrain present in the area around the region, hard for both trade and harvest, leaving not that much to exploit for our predecessors. Yet they needed to know a lot about these lands to travel across them safely."
 KRH_idea_2: "White Sandstone"

 KRH_idea_4_desc: "A small duchy may strive to be bigger and prepare in advance, and the system under which we operate is still the same our fathers did, but a bit better.

 JGA_idea_5: "Unrestricted Raiding"
 JGA_idea_5_desc: "While the rulers of Commonwealth and Russia wish to restrict our actions, we launch our own campaigns against nearby countries, and loot our enemies. But that's not enough for this day and age; we must gain more possibilities to act during wartime on our own."

 JGA_idea_6_desc: "As Bogdan Khmelnytsky led his armies to victories and defeats, his legacy as the fighter for freedom and his people spread across the lands. His deeds immortalized himself in the people's memories, yet on the state level we should acknowledge his military skills as well."

 VDD_idea_1: "Trading Hub for Slaves"
 VDD_idea_1_desc: "In the early and high Middle Ages, Verdun was a thriving long-distance trading city and a main hub for slaves. These were shipped from Eastern Europe to Verdun, castrated and sold as eunuchs to the Caliphate of Cordoba or Byzantium. Despite papal decrees against these practices, slave trade was too lucrative for the merchants of Verdun to stop."
 VDD_idea_2: "Treaty of Verdun"
 VDD_idea_2_desc: "Following the death in 840 of Louis the Pious, King of the Franks, his sons Lothair, Charles and Louis could not agree on their respective claims to their father's inheritance. In 843, the sons met at Verdun to divide the Frankish Empire into three parts in order to end their differences: Lothair established Lotharingia, Charles received West Francia (which would later become the Kingdom of France), and Louis was given East Francia (which would later turn into the Holy Roman Empire). Verdun is thus considered a truly prestigious city, where history has always been made."

 VDD_idea_7: "Withstand the Germans"
 VDD_idea_7_desc: "After the Napoleonic Wars, the fortifications of Verdun were massively expanded to protect against the menacing German states. In the Franco-Prussian War, Verdun was supposed to be a bulwark against the German armies, but in less than a month of siege, Verdun was occupied by the Germans in 1870.

 SRT_idea_2: "The Little Ones"
 SRT_idea_2_desc: "We have always needed an ally to defend our lands. A culture of sea with mountainous land and little people cannot do much to defend itself when an invader arrives.

 SRT_idea_3: "Well Known Mercenaries"
 SRT_idea_3_desc: "Mercenaries are quintessential to the existence of Sorrento. If we have no allies and it comes down to protecting our rugged lands from an invader, the Sorrentino army has no chance of winning. It is with mercenaries that we protect our lands. These mercenaries that we hire will protect our towns for as long as they will take tribute, and the longer they stay, the more it feels like they become Sorrento's true defenders."
 SRT_idea_4: "Rome's Lone Gone Escape"
 SRT_idea_4_desc: "Sorrento, Vico Equense, and other neighboring towns belonging to us have many historical Roman ruins. Some are the houses of important senators and generals, while others are necropolises that house the graves of many soldiers.

 SRT_idea_5: "The Siege At The Shoreline"
 SRT_idea_5_desc: "The Duchy of Benevento had only just finished conquering our brothers in Amalfi a year before they decided to march towards Sorrento. In 839, Sorrentino forces fought tooth and nail against the larger Lombard force. For months they held out, up until the Neapolitan armies came to our aid, resulting in a historic victory for our small nation. The fact that we managed to best the conquerors of our sworn enemies in Amalfi is something that the people of Sorrento have always shared a laugh about."
 SRT_idea_6: "Home Of Limoncello"
 SRT_idea_6_desc: "Limoncello has been the historical drink of Sorrento. Markets are lined with the alcoholic drink, as people walk about with a bottle in their hand to bring it home. Being made from the zest of lemons, its tart-sweet taste has made it a treasure to many. Limoncello brewers make sure to keep their recipes hidden from other brewers, so as to make sure that only few knew how to truly make it. That is why it took hundreds of years for it to finally escape our grasp, and wander into the eyes of the world."
 SRT_idea_7: "The Greatest Rivalry"
 SRT_idea_7_desc: "Sorrento and Amalfi hold the greatest rivalry of city states. Years upon years of both cities attempting to eclipse the other, eventually resulting with Amalfi finding success in trade. We on the other hand, were relegated to nothing more than seafarers to sit idly by as the world changed around us. This has to change. We will defeat Amalfi, and finally unite the peninsula named after us!"

 SLT_idea_4: "Oltu Stones"
 SLT_idea_4_desc: "Erzurum has natural reserves of Oltu stones, named after the Anatolian city of Oltu. This is a usually black or blackish gemstone made of jet i.e. lignite. The peculiarity of the Oltu stone is that it is usually very soft and hardens only when it comes into contact with air. This allows it to be easily carved and cut to make jewelry, pipes, or cigar holders."
 SLT_idea_5: "Abaza Rebellions"
 SLT_idea_5_desc: "Abaza Mehmet was Beylerbey of Erzurum who rebelled twice against the Ottoman Empire. After the corrupt Janissaries were accused of murdering Sultan Osman II in 1622, Abaza Mehmet began to expel all the Janissaries from Erzurum or have them killed. Supported by the Oghuz, he was quickly able to control much of central and eastern Anatolia. In 1624, he was defeated by Ottoman forces but allowed to retain his position as governor. During his second rebellion, in 1627, he again plotted against the Ottoman army, which he ambushed and scattered during the war against Persia. Only after Erzurum was taken by the Ottoman army Abaza Mehmet lost his position as Beylerbey of Erzurum."
 SLT_idea_6: "Erzurum Vilâyet"
 SLT_idea_6_desc: "The Vilâyet Erzurum belonged to the six Armenian Vilâyets of the Ottoman Empire, because Armenians represented the majority of the population here for centuries. However, there were also Georgian and Kurdish minorities. It was thus one of the most multicultural and multireligious provinces of the Ottoman Empire."
 SLT_idea_7: "Treaties of Erzurum"
 SLT_idea_7_desc: "Erzurum is an important place for diplomatic relations between the Ottomans and Persians, as two important treaties were signed here. The first Treaty of Erzurum ended the Ottoman-Persian War of 1821 to 1823 by defining the border between the two Empires and favoring bilateral trade. When the two countries were on the verge of a new war in 1847 due to renewed border disputes, Britain and Russia acted as mediators and divided the disputed territory between the Ottomans and Persians, which meant that there would never be another war between the Ottoman Empire and Persia."

 RUP_idea_2: "Wichmann von Arnstein"
 RUP_idea_2_desc: "Wichmann von Arnstein was the son of Count Walther III von Arnstein, who was elected bishop of Brandenburg in 1220 and founded the monastery of Ruppin together with his brother Gebhard. At some point, however, he gave up his political career and turned to mystical spirituality. Some legends have been passed down about his time as a mystic; for example, he is said to have walked across Lake Ruppin or to have convinced a catfish to voluntarily jump out of the lake into the pan of the monastery cook."
 RUP_idea_3: "Lake Ruppin"
 RUP_idea_3_desc: "Lake Ruppin is a long-drawn lake, on which, in addition to Ruppin, several fishing villages are located. Thanks to the large fish stocks, the lake was of economic importance for the region early on. In 1788, the lake was connected to the Havel River by means of a canal, allowing shipping from Ruppin to Berlin."

 RUP_idea_4_desc: "After Margrave Joachim I of Brandenburg was able to persuade Denmark and Lübeck to make peace in the Danish-Hanseatic War in 1511, trade in the Baltic region was finally restored. To celebrate the peace, he had a three-day jousting tournament held in Ruppin in 1512. It was a great success, and Ruppin stood out for its great hospitality."
 RUP_idea_5: "Legend of Mouse and Rat"
 RUP_idea_5_desc: "In 1564, the Reformation was introduced in Ruppin. A few days after that, two clergymen walked through the local monastery church, one of them Catholic, the other Lutheran. They argued about whether the Reformation could prevail in Ruppin or not. The Catholic predicted that it was more likely that a mouse would chase a rat across the church arch than that Ruppin would remain Lutheran. The Lutheran was silent and only pointed up to a beam of a vault: a rat was indeed being chased by a mouse. This legendary tale proves our righteous affiliation with the Reformation."
 RUP_idea_6: "Most Prussian of all Prussian Cities"
 RUP_idea_6_desc: "In 1787, Ruppin was almost completely destroyed when a wildfire ravaged the town. By 1803, the town had been rebuilt under Prussian building supervision. The new Ruppin now consisted of classicist houses, wide streets and many stately squares. Ruppin consequently offers an original and modern townscape."
 RUP_idea_7: "Theodor Fontane"
 RUP_idea_7_desc: "Ruppin is the birthplace of the famous novelist Theodor Fontane, who is considered an important representative of literary realism. His attachment to Ruppin and its picturesque surroundings is expressed in his works 'Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg' (Walks through the March of Brandenburg) and 'Der Stechlin' (The Stechlin). Ruppin thus justifiably carries the epithet 'Fontane Town'."

 aromanian_idea_1_desc: "The Aromanians have been living in seclusion for a long time in the mountainous regions of the Balkans, where they pursued a way of life as transhumant herders and pastoralists. In summer, they spend time high up in the pastures, living in temporary willow huts, while in winter they come down to the valleys, living in villages and cities. Although their lifestyle may seem nomadic on the surface, they are more like semi-nomads who live this life voluntarily and in close connection with their pastoral tradition."
 aromanian_idea_2: "Megalovlachitai"
 aromanian_idea_2_desc: "The Aromanians have always been subjects of other peoples. When the Depotate of Epirus ruled them after the Fourth Crusade, many Aromanians were conscripted into the army. As Megalovlachitai, they became known for their unbridled bravery and intrepidity in battle. This is not unusual, as the Aromanian are descended from Roman soldiers once stationed in the Balkans."
 aromanian_idea_3: "Christian Tattoos"
 aromanian_idea_3_desc: "At the age of about 13 or 14, Aromanian girls were tattooed with crosses or crucifixes on their foreheads or arms and the names of their brothers on their hands or fingers. Since tattoos as such, but especially those with Christian symbolism, are considered a sin in Islam, this tradition protected many Aromanian women from being taken as concubines into Turkish harems when the Ottoman Empire ruled the Balkans."
 aromanian_idea_4: "Moscopole"
 aromanian_idea_4_desc: "Due to the enormous influx of Aromanian families, the settlement of Moscopole developed into an important Balkan metropolis in the 17th and 18th centuries. The city turned not only into an economic center, but also into a cultural center for the Orthodox faith. Over twenty churches and monasteries have been built in the city, being famous for religious icon painting. A Greek academy, an orphanage and the first printing house in Southeast Europe were established here. Moscopole's prosperity ended quickly when Ali Pasha of Ioannina sacked the town in 1788 after the residents supported Greek resistance forces against Ottoman rule."
 aromanian_idea_5: "Heirs of Rome"
 aromanian_idea_5_desc: "'Aromanian' literally means 'Roman citizen'. This demonstrates the descent of the Aromanians from the Romans, when Latin soldiers began to settle in the Balkans from the 2nd century BC. When Germanic and Slavic barbarians invaded the Balkans in Late Antiquity, the Aromanians retreated to the mountains of the southern Balkans, where they were able to preserve their culture, preventing them from being assimilated. The Aromanian language derives from the Proto-Romanian language, which in turn derives from Vulgar Latin. Hence, there are several reasons thanks to which the Aromanians can be considered as Heirs of Rome."
 aromanian_idea_6: "Aromanian Merchants"
 aromanian_idea_6_desc: "In the 17th century, Aromanian merchants dominated trade in the Balkans. Their trade relations reached as far as Constantinople, Ragusa, Venice, Vienna, Leipzig, Krakow and beyond. The trading profits were used to operate several banks and endow churches. The Aromanian merchants were thus the strongest competitors for Greek and Jewish traders."
 aromanian_idea_7: "Chameleons of the Balkans"
 aromanian_idea_7_desc: "Aromanians are also referred to as the 'Chameleons of the Balkans' because they often adopted the identity of neighboring Slavic, Vlach or Greek peoples. When the various peoples of the Balkans began to rebel against Ottoman tyranny in the 19th century, many prominent Aromanians played important roles in Greek, Romanian, or Serbian politics of resistance, yet did not identify themselves as Aromanians. This delayed the formation of an own Aromanian identity, especially since a large proportion of them supported either Greek or Romanian nationalism."
