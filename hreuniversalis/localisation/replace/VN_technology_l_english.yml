#MIL Descs
 mil_tech_cs_0_desc: "The citizen soldier, the tribal warrior, essentially the non-professional. The starting point for any military."
 mil_tech_cs_1_desc: "The creation of a professional military class is the first step to creation of a modern army."
 mil_tech_cs_2_desc: "Born out of the cash-rich but manpower-poor city states of Italy, Condottieri were professional mercenary companies who worked for the highest bidder. In the high middle ages, their use was continually popularized as a way for ambitious states to quickly expand. But woe to the employer who fails to pay them!"
 mil_tech_cs_3_desc: "Spurs have been known since prehistory as a way to direct horses, engendering a sharp object attached to the heels of the rider. In Knightly Europe, spurs were made of gold and silver and were a symbol of prestige."
 mil_tech_cs_4_desc: "Unlike a normal bow, the crossbow could be wound up by its user to achieve spectacular kinetic power. The bows used bolts or quarrels, and were cheap to reproduce and train with."
 mil_tech_cs_5_desc: "Military monastic orders came to Europe in the era of the Crusades, in the form of fraternal societies. Templars, Hospitallers, Sepulchres, and Santiagos were matched by Islamic counterparts like the Nizari Ismailis or 'Hashashins'. Though they would later fall out of favor, they came to dominant Christian politics for over a century."
 mil_tech_cs_6_desc: "The easier it is to keep stable on a horse, the easier it is to fight from a horse. With the rise of Cavalry warfare in the middle ages, proper saddles are crucial to an effective military."
 mil_tech_cs_7_desc: "Trebuchets, Catapults, Ballistas - the timeless machines of sieging protected cities had to be developed upon in the age of Castles and Crusades to account for new defensive improvements."
 mil_tech_cs_8_desc: "Knightly surcoats made of linen were worn over mail armor, and bore symbols of the knight's allegiance. It is from these coats that the term 'coat of arms' is derived, as they were the first step in the development of heraldry."
 mil_tech_cs_9_desc: "Another one of the greatest innovations of the crusader era was the spread of concentric castle designs. When defending small enclaves against massive enemies, it was important to have multiple sets of curtain walls with continually heightened battlements the more inward they fell."
 mil_tech_cs_10_desc: "The Komnenian restoration in Byzantium took place roughly from 1080 to 1180, and saw the reorganization of defense efforts into local rapid-response armies rather than singular national armies. We should spread such tactics throughout our lands."
 mil_tech_cs_11_desc: "The idea of a nation-state would not take off for nearly a millennia, but this did not preclude a patriotic obligation to ones' liege."
 mil_tech_cs_12_desc: "Working together with other states is necessary to take down larger foes. Often, vassals of major polities like the Kingdom of France would band together into pseudo-rebellion to win rights and independence from the King."
 mil_tech_cs_13_desc: "Javelins were throwing weapons which saw great popularity amongst the old Anglo-Saxons, and continued to be used by Islamic and Eastern forces throughout the middle ages."
 mil_tech_cs_14_desc: "When siege weapons are not adequate, like at the great Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, besiegers must resort to mining or 'sapping' - literally digging underneath walls to undermine their structural integrity (no pun intended)."
 mil_tech_cs_15_desc: "The logical conclusion to surcoats is to cover oneself not with mere linen but with hard plate armor which can withstand blows from swords or even arrow glances. With the rise of plates, surcoats fell out of usage."
 mil_tech_cs_16_desc: "The English longbow was decisive in achieving victory at Agincourt. Powerful, easy to manufacture, and used in tandem with peasant levies, it could tear apart the defences of armored knights."
 mil_tech_cs_17_desc: "Plate armor is bulky and hard to maneuver in. Brigandine armor solves the issue by replacing pure steel with leather or fabric lined with smaller bits of metal."
 mil_tech_cs_18_desc: "Unlike Condottieri and other mercenary groups, Routiers were organized into 'Routes' or 'Bands'. Though fearsome, they had a reputation for disobedience and terrorized the countryside during the Hundred Years War. As long as we pay them well, they should be of no trouble to us."
 mil_tech_cs_19_desc: "Originating in China, gunpowder is a mix of charcoal, sulphur, and saltpeter. It has powerful explosive capabilities and revolutionized global warfare wholesale by allowing for explosive artillery and primitive firearms. At all costs, we need to adopt the recipe of this invention and start producing it across the nation to supply our armed forces."
 mil_tech_cs_20_desc: "Pavisiers used Pavises, giant decorated shields large enough to protect their entire body. By supplying them to archers, we can allow for alternations of arrow fire and protection from enemy counterattacks."
 mil_tech_cs_21_desc: "Recurve bows are differentiated from normal bows in that the arms bend away from the bowman when not in use. This gives them greater power, and allows the storing of more energy in a smaller bow, which will be helpful in inhospitable terrain like forests."
 mil_tech_cs_22_desc: "Another name for the typical Knight of the middle ages. Whether mercenary or nobleman, Men-at-Arms were trained in mounted warfare above all else."
 mil_tech_cs_23_desc: "The Pike is a type of long spear which gives the bearer a length advantage over his enemy. Their effectiveness as an unmounted infantry weapon wound be nearly unrivaled for many centuries, and the most popular medieval formations were developed around them."
 mil_tech_cs_24_desc: "Wood can rot and snap, even when handled by the best carpenters and craftsmen. Steel, on the other hand, has no such downside. By reimagining our crossbow designs out of steel, we can greatly improve their effectiveness and once again redouble their power on the field."
 mil_tech_cs_25_desc: "Also known as an Organ-Gun, Ribauldequins were a series of tubes attached together and filled with anti-personnel shot. Their advantage lay in their range of fire, creating a wall effect."
 mil_tech_cs_26_desc: "Combining all cutting-edge defensive tricks, like moats, curtain walls, machicolations, and murder holes, will allow for a new category of defensive fortresses nearly impenetrable to traditional siege tactics."
 mil_tech_cs_27_desc: "The drying process of gunpowder was rife with unpredictability, as air could get into the substance and change its potency. By 'corning' gunpowder, producers would form the paste into corn-sized bits that would work better in the barrels of weapons. This innovation was believed to have increased the power output of said weapons as much as three hundred percent."
 mil_tech_cs_28_desc: "A medium between old surcoats and more protective armor has been reached - the Jupon. Short almost to the point of being like a vest, Jupons could bear heraldric symbols and provide even more protection without sacrificing any movement or defense."
 mil_tech_cs_29_desc: "Charging blindly at the enemy is perhaps not the greatest tactic known to man, but it is one of the simplest to master. It is also the stepping stone to more advanced strategies."
 mil_tech_cs_30_desc: "Of all the battle formations of the early modern era, the Wedge was one of the most popular. Some battles would involve two opposing armies heading directly at each other both in wedge formation. It was popularly known to Germans as the 'Spitz' and also saw currency in the Cataphract armies of Byzantium."
 mil_tech_cs_31_desc: "Retainers of a feudal lord were expensive to take care of, but cavalry improvements in the late Medieval period allowed for lords to command even mounted retinues, like the Druzhina Cavalry of Eastern Europe."
 mil_tech_cs_32_desc: "No longer just a coat or a threading of leather with metal, full Plate Armor is the most sophisticated protective invention available, using advanced joint engineering to allow for freedom of movement. We must capitalize on these discoveries at once!"
 mil_tech_cs_33_desc: "The design philosophy behind the jupon can be extended once again to full body armor. Gambesons were padded jackets that covered the underlying plate-based armor, but did not suffer from the same drawbacks as surcoats."
 mil_tech_cs_34_desc: "The next step from mounted professional cavalry is mounted professional heavy cavalry. Popular in France through much of the late middle ages, Gendarmes were armed with lances and were often of noble birth."
 mil_tech_cs_35_desc: "By the end of the middle ages the land armies had become more professional and well organized. Better systems are in place to support the mix of levies and professional soldiers that now dominate the battle fields and the power of infantry is slowly but steadily gaining on the cavalry arm."
 mil_tech_cs_36_desc: "Throughout the middle ages cavalry's dominance was being challenged by disciplined pikemen. In battles such as Bannockburn or the Golden Spurs, cavalry was defeated by pikes. A combination of improved training and discipline, and the addition of swordsmen to provide close combat support has raised this formation to the peak of its efficiency."
 mil_tech_cs_37_desc: "A pike is a remarkably simple weapon to make, but to get the full benefit from the use of pikes, it's required for the whole formation to be wielding weapons of similar length and blade."
 mil_tech_cs_38_desc: "Although hand cannons had been developed in China in the 12th century and had spread to Europe by the 14th, the weakness of these weapons reduced their battlefield utility. Light and reliable Arquebus was able to displace bow due to three main factors. It had better armor penetration, it was easier to train men to use it, and it did not rely on the strength of the user."
 mil_tech_cs_39_desc: "The immediate predecessor to modern artillery, superguns were massive, unmaneuverable, and prone to random catastrophic failure, but they allowed for much quicker siege warfare and paved the way for the popularization of other cannons."
 mil_tech_cs_40_desc: "Artillery had been documented in Europe since the thirteenth century, but due to its lack of mobility, it had very limited battlefield use. The development of the Limber in the 1470s allowed guns to become more mobile and thus useful."
 mil_tech_cs_41_desc: "The Arquebus was easy to use as a weapon, but was also inaccurate and slow to fire, leaving its user vulnerable to cavalry charges. Blending with Pikemen allowed Arquebusiers to fire and then fall back to be shielded by Pikemen when enemy cavalry or infantry appeared."
 mil_tech_cs_42_desc: "The value of training and experience has always been great on the battlefield. With the advent of gunpowder and the tactical changes associated with it and other infantry weapons came a great demand for units versed in these new innovations. As professional armies were still far away this need had to be filled by mercenary units such as the Condottieri, Swiss Mercenaries or Landsknechts. A growing class of professional mercenary officers came to live of supplying these regiments to needing states in the middle of the military transition."
 mil_tech_cs_43_desc: "Bastions project out from the walls of castles and allow the defenders to attack the besieging forces at an angle, almost flanking them. Introducing them to our defensive repertoire will greatly help with the defense of the nation."
 mil_tech_cs_44_desc: "Pike and shot formations proved a major threat to medieval knights. The initial response was heavier armor to counter the power of gunpowder weapons, but this slowed down cavalry, reducing their shock power. Reiters were usually armed with two pistols and a sword, allowing them to either shoot or charge depending on the opposition they faced."
 mil_tech_cs_45_desc: "The Arquebus proved to be a very effective weapon for armor penetration, the result was that armor began to get heavier to resist its fire. A larger musket could deliver a heavier round offering better armor penetration "
 mil_tech_cs_46_desc: "Spanish Square developed naturally from the Pike and shot formations. At its core was a traditional Pike Square. At each of the corners it had a group of Arquebusiers. It kept the staying power of the traditional pike square and enhanced it with the firepower of the Arquebus."
 mil_tech_cs_47_desc: "The new and more mobile artillery had one problem - it could not be easily elevated up and down to adjust its firing range. Trunnions were cylindrical protrusions that acted as mounts for the gun on its carriage, which allowed it to be tilted and thus aimed better."
 mil_tech_cs_48_desc: "It was difficult to fire around curved walls, thus once attackers got close enough to the fortification, the ability of other parts of the defenses to provide flanking fire was nullified. The development of star-shaped bastions allowed every part of the wall to be supported from other parts."
 mil_tech_cs_49_desc: "The size and depth of the Spanish Square gave it staying power but made it slow and cumbersome to maneuver on the battlefield. It also led to a large percentage of troops being inactive during battles. Maurice of Nassau, the Stadtholder of the Netherlands, reduced the total number of men in the formation to make it more mobile and reduced its depth, so it maintained the same firepower and shock values."
 mil_tech_cs_50_desc: "With artillery's growing importance in the battlefield, also the number of firearms kept increasing. But because each gun was made separately, it also required great effort to resupply. In 1544, Emperor Charles V declared that there would be only 5 calibres of gun, while King Henry II of France set 6 standard calibres."
 mil_tech_cs_51_desc: "The quincunx is a geometric pattern of five points, either in the form of a cross or a square with one in the middle, like on a die. Arranging army units in such a formation would improve our tactical advantage."
 mil_tech_cs_52_desc: "The matchlock firing mechanism's biggest weakness was the need to keep the match lit in order to fire the weapon. Although wheellock was developed, it was too expensive to produce to enter into mass use. The development of flintlock created a more reliable weapon."
 mil_tech_cs_53_desc: "The carbine was a shorter form of the musket."
 mil_tech_cs_54_desc: "Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, further developed infantry units to improve their firepower. His infantry formations were narrowed and made rectangular to increase the number of muskets that could fire in each volley. Attachment of small artillery pieces further increased the firepower of infantry."
 mil_tech_cs_55_desc: "With development of new bastions engineers began to improve the art of positioning them to channel attacking armies into specially prepared killing grounds, where the defenders could inflict maximum amount of casualties on their enemy."
 mil_tech_cs_56_desc: "Thanks to bayonets, each musketeer could function as a pikeman as well. This allowed pikes to be removed from infantry equipment and provided infantry formations with more firepower."
 mil_tech_cs_57_desc: "Fusilier is a general term for musketeer soldiers or elite units trained in artillery warfare."
 mil_tech_cs_58_desc: "In the 1620s the idea of combining the shot and powder into a single unit, a cartridge, allowed for faster reloading and thus firing. This in turn dramatically improved the firepower of guns."
 mil_tech_cs_59_desc: "Heavily armored cavalrymen were by their nature cumbersome to form up and vulnerable on the battlefield. Lighter cavalry was added to armies to act as scouts for the army during marching and screen heavier cavalry before its charge on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_cs_60_desc: "An outer ditch became a key area for the siege. If attacking troops gained control of the glacis, then the bastions would be lost. The ditch became the first line of defense for a fort. Access to this ditch, and ensuring it kept providing protection to defending troops became a key part of fortification design."
 mil_tech_cs_61_desc: "Improvements in metallurgy allowed cannons to become lighter and more reliable. This allowed them to become more effective on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_cs_62_desc: "Heavy Cavalry was popular in the middle ages. But with the proliferation of firearms, there is once again strong reason to return to light cavalry. Uhlans, originating in Poland, bore little more than pistols and sabres and were quite maneuverable."
 mil_tech_cs_63_desc: "First introduced to the Austrian army as irregular troops from the military frontier during the Seven Years war, Light Infantry Companies were deployed in loose order and proved to be very effective at harassing enemy and leading assaults on entrenchments."
 mil_tech_cs_64_desc: "Although a musket could always be wielded as a club, it was not an effective hand-to-hand weapon. A bayonet was a blade that was fitted to the end of a musket, allowing the weapon to function as a spear. Initial bayonet designs plugged the barrel, making it an either or choice, but the development of the ring bayonet, which fitted around the barrel, turned a musket into a useful support weapon."
 mil_tech_cs_65_desc: "Although a cuirass (or a breast plate) had existed for many years, only recently a new style of cavalryman gained popularity, with only a breast and back plate, which provided better balance between protection to the key parts of the body and mobility."
 mil_tech_cs_66_desc: "Originally the elite elements of the French light cavalry, these mounted Carabiners eventually became recognized as independent units and spread throughout European military practices."
 mil_tech_cs_67_desc: "Thanks to the building of several layers of fortification, overrunning of outer bastions simply moved the siege to the next layer, forcing attackers to prepare new locations to site guns and increasing the length of the siege."
 mil_tech_cs_68_desc: "The introduction of light infantry troops led to a change in warfare. Skirmishers were deployed forward in loose order to distract and harass the enemy before the main infantry attack, which was typically delivered in either a line or a column."
 mil_tech_cs_69_desc: "Armies have long been organized into different units. Reforming their organizations and establishing new Corps will make our whole war machine run more efficiently."
 mil_tech_cs_70_desc: "The musket's weakness was the fact that it was highly inaccurate beyond 50 yards. The rifle, although never a standard infantry weapon, added greater range to elite units, which gave the army a greater overall punch."
 mil_tech_cs_71_desc: "Originally developed for siege purposes, the howitzer fired a high angled projectile over the fortifications and into the town inside. The field howitzer, a lighter more mobile variant, would fire an explosive shell above enemy troops. Mixed with other artillery types, it added to the effectiveness of artillery brigades."
 mil_tech_cs_72_desc: "We have had Cartridges for many years now, but inventors have now followed this technology up with the Percussion Cap, which will allow our rifles to fire much more reliably no matter what conditions they are gone. Gone are the days of slow and unreliable flintlocks."
 mil_tech_cs_73_desc: "Though firearms are on the rise, mounted Dragoons still have their role in a modern military. We only need to supply them with the most modern and effective sabres."
 mil_tech_cs_74_desc: "Johann Nicolaus von Dreyse first designed the Dreyse Needle Gun in the early 1800s - a rifle which operated with a needle-like firing pin. Prussians were particularly fond of it and slowly turned it into the standard firearm of their military, leading them to great victories."
 mil_tech_cs_75_desc: "As explosive chemical engineering and precision manufacturing improved, so too did Howitzers. From siege weapons to anti-personnel weapons, new Howitzers are even more easy to produce and operate."

#ADM Descs
 adm_tech_cs_0_desc: "With a military elite to govern our society, the next stage of development is to have a literate class of administrators. Usually these will be drawn from the ranks of clergy."
 adm_tech_cs_1_desc: "The craftsman and his apprentice were a backbone of medieval production. Though guilds were a later development, craftsmen took pride in their work and their specialty would be known to the surrounding lands."
 adm_tech_cs_2_desc: "Liquor is produced by distilling already-fermented beverages to increase their alcoholic potency. While it has its naysayers, liquor production is a lucrative industry - there are rumors of a faraway land called 'Liquoria II' where an entire economy can be built on it."
 adm_tech_cs_3_desc: "For centuries weaving was done on vertical looms. Based on Chinese technology, the horizontal loom made it such that a weaver only had to operate foot-treadles, greatly expanding output and ease."
 adm_tech_cs_4_desc: "Choosing the direction a country is going to take is perhaps the toughest choice a ruler will ever face. National ideas are the concepts that will shape our country for years to come."
 adm_tech_cs_5_desc: "Certain men from Normandy have invented a system wherein a litter is suspended between two horses by poles to carry wounded soldiers. We must adopt this practice immediately."
 adm_tech_cs_6_desc: "Hops are a certain type of flower which can be added to the production process of beer to fortify it and give it better taste. I say beer is in dire need of such a revolution, but I'm skeptical of how much can be done."
 adm_tech_cs_7_desc: "The use of high-pressure liquid for power purposes has been known since ancient times. It was described by Vitruvius as early as the first century AD, in the form of Roman pipes."
 adm_tech_cs_8_desc: "One cannot have a sophisticated economy without currency. Though Roger of Sicily first coined them, it was the Venetian Ducat that gained widespread prominence as the de-facto early currency of Europe."
 adm_tech_cs_9_desc: "Rather than having to stamp ones' feet down on grapes to prepare them for wine production, why not let a machine do the task?"
 adm_tech_cs_10_desc: "They are pestilential, they are pests. It is imperative, in the interest of protecting foodstores and other such goods, that we innovate in the area of rat and mouse control."
 adm_tech_cs_11_desc: "Westerners now borrow mathematical insights from Arabia and India, such as the Arabic numeral system and algebra. Figures such as Fibonacci lived in the Islamic world and returned with the knowledge they had gained."
 adm_tech_cs_12_desc: "Chimneys can direct smoke from fire or smelting out of a space. Though they wouldn't find widespread popularity for centuries, one of the first medieval examples was Conisbrough Castle in Yorkshire, England."
 adm_tech_cs_13_desc: "Moving around harvested materials or supplies may seem trivial, but I doubt one would think the same if one actually had to carry them around in sacks. Wheeled transportation vessels may actually revolutionize the farming industry."
 adm_tech_cs_14_desc: "In France, a new architectural style known as 'the Gothic' has risen to popularity, finding usage in churches and cathedrals across the King's lands. The rest of Europe is slowly adopting the same style."
 adm_tech_cs_15_desc: "Cathedrals and other glorious monuments cannot be built without the movement of heavy materials up large heights. The treadwheel crane allows precisely the sort of hoisting and lowering we need."
 adm_tech_cs_16_desc: "Soapmaking was popular in the West from antiquity, finding particular prominence in Carolingian-era Naples. By the high medieval era, it has spread to England where it was treated with respect on par with smithing and baking."
 adm_tech_cs_17_desc: "A defining characteristic of Gothic architecture is its use of buttresses, or pillared support structures, to bear the weight of ceilings."
 adm_tech_cs_18_desc: "We have solved height issues with treadwheel cranes. Now, building on that success, we have solved length issues with mast cranes. Building construction has never before been so easy."
 adm_tech_cs_19_desc: "Angered by continual taxation and failed wars, at the turn of the 13th century English magnates forced King John into signing the Magna Carta. Though he almost immediately reneged on his promises, the precedent for parliamentary monarchy was set."
 adm_tech_cs_20_desc: "Guilds rise across the continent, and with them craftsmen strangle entire industries into monopoly. Surely, if a guild is powerful enough to establish complete control, it must therefore have good products?"
 adm_tech_cs_21_desc: "Glasses were first invented in late-13th-century Italy, and quickly spread among the scholarly classes of Europe. Originally, they were simply held in front of the face rather than mounted."
 adm_tech_cs_22_desc: "Improving communication infrastructure allows for a better integration of those frontier realms which were historically more of a satellite collection than an integral part of any empire. The Eastern March - Austria - was once such a realm."
 adm_tech_cs_23_desc: "The use of paper currency has long been known to China, and while Venetian ducats see credit across the West, only now have more sophisticated currency constructs been developed."
 adm_tech_cs_24_desc: "Windmills are another technology which have seen some use since time immemorial but are now in the midst of a revival. Across the Lowlands and France, the power of wind is being harvested to crush grain and other materials."
 adm_tech_cs_25_desc: "Rotary Grindstones were developed upon by figures like Guido va Vigeano and Konrad Kyeser into more advanced practical cranking systems. Why do the Italians always seem to be involved in these inventions?"
 adm_tech_cs_26_desc: "Bridges have been a fascination amongst engineers throughout history. There is an ancient legend that Caligula road his horse across a floating oceanic bridge. Today, however, the use of segmented arches as a support structure has allowed much more stable and robust bridges to be constructed."
 adm_tech_cs_27_desc: "So long as technology allows for better communication and information gathering, it will be put to the purposes of government."
 adm_tech_cs_28_desc: "Master Kurtz is dead! The horror, the horror! Black corruption, born of infernal machinations, boils the skin of innocents and hangs in the air like a funeral shroud. Worms feast on fingers yet deceased! Sable cries echo off disinterested battlements! But we are /comfy/, for we have quarantined the whole region."
 adm_tech_cs_29_desc: "The citizenry have complained about bureaucracy for millennia, giving it such labels as 'byzantine' or 'kafkaesque'. They do not realize, however, that bureaucracy is the key to a stable nation."
 adm_tech_cs_30_desc: "The Knights Hospitaller originally got their name due to their operation of hospitals in the holy land - sites for the treatment of the wounded. Repurposing such an innovation for general usage will go a long way in bolstering our nation's power."
 adm_tech_cs_31_desc: "New tactics in engineering to drain swampy flatlands and create polders to keep out water allow for the reclamation of surface area once thought irredeemable."
 adm_tech_cs_32_desc: "The Normans and Anglo-Saxons were some of the first in Europe to create large-scale world maps. Arabic cartographers, however, are the most excellent, and their practices allow for us to stare upon our lands as they actually are for perhaps the first time ever."
 adm_tech_cs_33_desc: "The idea of a monastic Abbot or Abbess also holding secular power seems somehow wrong, but the practice was widespread throughout the Holy Roman Empire in all the premodern eras."
 adm_tech_cs_34_desc: "Architectural and Engineering braces had a wide variety of uses, all of which greatly improved upon more unpredictable older methodologies. We are much more confident in the construction of infrastructure when we know our machines won't snap apart and kill government overseers."
 adm_tech_cs_35_desc: "Remember, no Old East Slavic."
 adm_tech_cs_36_desc: "Housing the machinery of government is as important as the machinery itself and one should never forget of the importance of religion when doing so."
 adm_tech_cs_37_desc: "All new truths start as heresies and end as superstitions. Well, most, anyway. Some ideas stand the test of time and shape the direction of entire nations."
 adm_tech_cs_38_desc: "Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the Workshop - or 'Putting-out System' - was used in Early Modern Europe to organize the production of everything from Textiles to Wrought Iron. With materials provided, craftsmen could refine various goods either in workshops or in their own home, bypassing the rigid restrictions of the guilds."
 adm_tech_cs_39_desc: "Manorial farming saw its height in the medieval era, but it didn't die out until quite some time later, when new production methods overtook it."
 adm_tech_cs_40_desc: "The notion of a noble oligarchy ruling the society has existed, since well, at least the Roman times, and remained popular in some parts of the world. Now this idea is once more gaining popularity amongst those who matter."
 adm_tech_cs_41_desc: "The problem with a hereditary local nobility is that they tend to value their local interests over those of the rest of the nation. We need to steadily expand the reach of the government, which begins with the most important area of administration, justice."
 adm_tech_cs_42_desc: "Although it has been in existence for a long time, the scythe somehow still isn't the most popular tool for harvesting crops. By encouraging peasants to use a scythe instead of a sickle we will improve the efficiency of our harvests."
 adm_tech_cs_43_desc: "The notion has popped up before in ancient heresies, but now it has returned with a vengeance. How does one deal with the notion that, no matter what they do, they are destined to the same ultimate fate?"
 adm_tech_cs_44_desc: "The development of the social structure is not exclusive to the aristocracy. The clergy too have to improve their internal governance. This will assist in the development of modern thought in our country."
 adm_tech_cs_45_desc: "Textiles were manufactured since time immemorial. The invention of stocking frame in 1589 was the first step towards the industrial revolution and the beginning of mechanization. This invention would lead to increase in textile production."
 adm_tech_cs_46_desc: "In time it became apparent that a more centralized bureaucracy with administrative bodies run by educated officials employed directly by the state was a necessity for the ambitious projects of the Early Modern rulers."
 adm_tech_cs_47_desc: "The more land we can cultivate, the bigger the population we can feed in that area. Gradual improvements in drainage have led to wetlands being brought into use."
 adm_tech_cs_48_desc: "While it is true that we stand on the shoulders of our ancestors, it is high time that we start to learn about the world from our own, well documented observations. By observing the world around us and by experimenting to prove or disprove our ideas about it we can reach further than those before us."
 adm_tech_cs_49_desc: "The ever increasing armies of the 16th century put bigger and harder demands on the administrative systems of states. By creating a permanent organization charged with taking care of the procuring and planning of Military supplies and by keeping more troops on the rolls even during wintertime or peacetime we will in the long run be able to field large armies more cheaply and be able to support these armies more efficiently while at war."
 adm_tech_cs_50_desc: "The process to produce wrought iron was under continuous improvement and by the early 17th century the finery process came to overtake the older Osmond process. Iron production could now be specialized with the working of the iron no longer taking place at the same location as it was mined and more, stronger and purer iron would in time lead to developments in many other sectors."
 adm_tech_cs_51_desc: "As opposed to obscure ancient documents and Domesday Books detailing who owns what, the assigning of deeds of ownership streamlined early modern administration."
 adm_tech_cs_52_desc: "The great medieval universities were of course great but they were not able to produce enough graduates to staff our growing administration. We need to expand our universities or we will fall behind."
 adm_tech_cs_53_desc: "The many and long wars of the first half of the 17th century have led to an international diplomatic system where the territorial integrity of states is a cornerstone. States rather than individual rulers or supra-national groupings are the actors on the international arena and no state has the right to intervene in the internal affairs of another."
 adm_tech_cs_54_desc: "Promotion of religion will be crucial for the stability of the realm. It is not enough to be great, people must be able to see our greatness. The ancients knew how to display their greatness and we will do the same by building monuments to withstand the test of time."
 adm_tech_cs_55_desc: "There are many people who demand to be given a role in the government, but in reality mostly want rewards without effort. A new interesting idea of absolutism is spreading, which is a system where we dispose of those parasites and govern alone."
 adm_tech_cs_56_desc: "Large-scale woodlands are of course useful as a source of firewood and a place for hunting, but if the trees were to go, those lands could be used for farming instead."
 adm_tech_cs_57_desc: "A new philosophical concept called constitutionalism has been developed, where the government accepts legal limits to its power. This is an intriguing idea, but I can't see it catching on."
 adm_tech_cs_58_desc: "There is no greater way to keep the populace happy than by giving them the illusion that they have a say in government. Town halls and councils are an excellent way to foster this illusion."
 adm_tech_cs_59_desc: "The new sciences have given us a number of different ways to describe and measure the world around us. Let us send these learned men out into the world in general and into our country in particular. We cannot know what resources are at our disposal until we have thoroughly searched all our lands for minerals, counted every last subject and assessed every last enterprise."
 adm_tech_cs_60_desc: "Paying for the upkeep of the army, the navy and the administration itself accounts for the majority of the expenses for any state. As these are expenses that can run away quickly however taxes and tolls can be frustrating and inflexible ways to raise the money needed. While national debt is far from unheard of we need to come up with better plans for raising money. Bonds, tontines and other similar plans can be used both domestically and abroad to finance unforeseen expenses and will allow us to make much better use of the money we do have to develop our country."
 adm_tech_cs_61_desc: "Since ancient times, many have dreamed of cutting canals between bodies of water, but current excavation technology finally allows the West to make the dream come true. Kiel, Panama, Corinth, Perth, Suez - all will eventually see fruition."
 adm_tech_cs_62_desc: "Having the technical means to improve land and thus production is useless without incentives to do so. By reforming the laws of land tenure we can provide greater incentives to adopt improved methods of production."
 adm_tech_cs_63_desc: "An anonymous treatise on political theory has emerged, and despite efforts to suppress it it is quickly spreading across the world. It deals with the nature of forms of government, be they monarchies, despotisms, or democracies, and argues for a strict separation of the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches. This would protect the people and limit the power of a monarch, which is understandably a very popular prospect for many of our subjects. Despite the unfortunate implications for the power of monarchs, these ideas may well benefit our nation greatly."
 adm_tech_cs_64_desc: "In order to make the most of the lands and subjects we control we must enlarge, reorganize and professionalize our bureaucracy. A robust organization can handle each part of our state and eliminate the need for ad hoc solutions. Let us put our universities at work to consider the best ways to efficiently rule and govern and let us encourage the sons of the nobility to serve the state with a pen in hand rather than a sword."
 adm_tech_cs_65_desc: "The basic plow in use in Europe has been unchanged since the Roman times. Now, thanks to improvements in design, the same plough can be made much lighter, reducing workload on draft animals, allowing them to do more work."
 adm_tech_cs_66_desc: "Presaging outright revolution is the notion that people have a right to self-determination; in essence, anti-colonialism. Across the seas, the Thirteen Colonies spread the ideals around, inspiring European counterparts."
 adm_tech_cs_67_desc: "At the forefront of current revolutionary thought is the radical notion of equality for all. Philosophers from different parts of the world have worked together to create a document entitled the 'Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen', proclaiming that these rights are universal and should be enforced by law. It is likely that this will have ample repercussions for the development and spread of the concepts of freedom and democracy, and we would do well not to lag behind."
 adm_tech_cs_68_desc: "Fortunately for us, the so-called enlightened philosophers didn't restrict themselves to writing subversive political treaties, but they also have come up with ideas in the areas of science and engineering. These are a boon to our economy and have led to an increase in production."
 adm_tech_cs_69_desc: "These foolish revolutionaries think they can simply consign hundreds of years of progress to the dustbin of history, all in the name of such outlandish concepts as liberty and equality. We will defeat them through the tried and tested plan of stealing the bits and pieces of their ideas that we like."
 adm_tech_cs_70_desc: "Across the artistic world, people turn to Romanticism, a high-style movement dedicated to the liminal, the sublime, the reintegration of Man into the natural world."
 adm_tech_cs_71_desc: "My secretary of state assures me that the switch to clover as a fodder crop and the addition of the turnip in a ‘four field’ rotation will increase yields in agriculture. I am inclined to promote this idea."
 adm_tech_cs_72_desc: "From John Stuart Mill to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, new theories of an economic science have emerged across the continent. We ought to embrace this new scholarly field."
 adm_tech_cs_73_desc: "Steel, Iron, Flax, mills and factories spewing out products by the shipload, great towers breathing contagion into the once-clear skies of the Angevins and Hohenstaufers. It's a sight to behold."
 adm_tech_cs_74_desc: "The unification of once disparate peoples has been at the forefront of recent European thought. Through such figures as Otto von Bismarck and Giuseppe Garibaldi, 19th-century Germans and Italians finally joined unified polities."
 adm_tech_cs_75_desc: "The rush for Africa has begun. But why stop at Africa? Every nation in the world should bow to Western power, from the former colonies in the New World to the solemn Mandarins of the far east."

#DIP Descs
 dip_tech_cs_0_desc: "Shipbuilding can mean a lot of different things, it is amazing how far you can get on a raft for example. However, this is not the same as creating a fleet to enforce policies of a state. This requires a whole different approach to the building of ships, as well as developing ways to control the navy you've build."
 dip_tech_cs_1_desc: "The Vikings, scourge of civilization as they were, pioneered sea-based exploration for the Western world. There are legends that they even discovered strange lands beyond the farthest documented points of Iceland. Building off their discoveries, we can begin to send our own boats into more treacherous waters."
 dip_tech_cs_2_desc: "Stars have guided seafaring men since time immemorial. Borrowing from Islamic and Eastern expertise, new practices of astrological navigation have been opened to the Western world."
 dip_tech_cs_3_desc: "The patterns of trade had been seriously disrupted in the 10th century, possibly due to large scale political restructuring. Now trade is slowly beginning to recover."
 dip_tech_cs_4_desc: "The idea is simple, really. When religious conviction holds so much sway, why not turn warfare into a religious ritual in itself, offering salvation and forgiveness to all who partake? Rival polities with centuries-old disputes can put aside their differences and Crusade together."
 dip_tech_cs_5_desc: "Culture is a murky concept, floating at the outskirts of historical narratives. We now see the flowering of what might be considered a large-scale cultural identarian awakening in the continent."
 dip_tech_cs_6_desc: "Chess was first played in the antique Middle East, indeed the word 'check' is derived from Persian 'Shah', meaning 'King'. This game of strategic genius is on the rise in popularity."
 dip_tech_cs_7_desc: "Unlike normal wells and underwater bodies, Artesian Aquifers are under pressure, and will spurt upward until equilibrium has been reached."
 dip_tech_cs_8_desc: "New methods in pigment mixing have led to Oil Paint, wherein pigments are suspended in a slow-drying oily substance, usually linseed. This has reinvigorated the whole medium of painting and artistry."
 dip_tech_cs_9_desc: "A nocturnal can determine time by starlight. This should be quite helpful in far-reaching exploratory expeditions."
 dip_tech_cs_10_desc: "Ambitious Normans have taken to reviving the old practices of world mapping famously put forth by Ptolemy. Though their handling of land is questionable, this should help sea navigation."
 dip_tech_cs_11_desc: "How do they work? It doesn't matter to the state, we just know they are effective in raising the capabilities of our navy."
 dip_tech_cs_12_desc: "Side mounted rudders became untenable as the size and importance of naval vessels increased in Europe. Now, they are being replaced with more effective stern mounted rudders for steering."
 dip_tech_cs_13_desc: "You cannot maintain a naval force without proper facilities with which to house and repair it."
 dip_tech_cs_14_desc: "The recipe for paper was originally discovered in the East. Now, it has spread to the Western world in favor of older vellum and Roman weaved parchments. The whole field of documentation and scholarship will be served by this innovation."
 dip_tech_cs_15_desc: "The pride of the Byzantine navy for many centuries, Dromons are a type of galley. Though they would eventually give way to Italian-style galleys, for now, let us command the seas with them."
 dip_tech_cs_16_desc: "Traditionally, compasses worked by placing weak magnetic material in water and seeing the direction in which it points. Engineering breakthroughs now allow for a dry compass, which is much more portable and will be a great boon to navigators and explorers on land and sea alike."
 dip_tech_cs_17_desc: "Let hundreds of ships meet on the open seas, just as the ancients did their ship-to-ship battles. Battles from Pisa to the English Channel are now relying on numbers more than ever."
 dip_tech_cs_18_desc: "Just as the development of better cranes has boosted architectural and construction interests, it can be used at dock sites to better build and repair ships."
 dip_tech_cs_19_desc: "Cogs were single-masted vessels built of northern European oak and square-rigged sails. Their transportation capacity was unrivaled, and as such they saw wide use by trading cities."
 dip_tech_cs_20_desc: "In the north of Europe, several powerful mercantile cities have banded together in a trade league, granting each other special privileges. Cities around the continent are joining the alliance, boosting their trade output significantly."
 dip_tech_cs_21_desc: "To insert a subtle identifier in documents is a great way to protect against fraud and ensure the legitimacy of all licenses and bills of service."
 dip_tech_cs_22_desc: "Clockmaking is a fine art that has gone through many revisions over the centuries. Currently, large scale clocks built by expert craftsmen can even be mounted in town squares or other areas of governmental importance."
 dip_tech_cs_23_desc: "The surcoats of old Knights gave way to a symbol of personal identification called Heraldry. Heraldric 'Coats of Arms' would display shields with symbols relevant to the Knight or noble family, such as eagles or crosses. A whole language of heraldric terms has likewise emerged around the system."
 dip_tech_cs_24_desc: "Just as Saint Thomas ventured around the globe promoting the Gospels, and Mohammed's generals traveled far and wide, we should now tie a religious significance to our naval expeditions. Let no Jonahs try to escape from their duties."
 dip_tech_cs_25_desc: "Sand or other fine granular materials falling between two glass spaces is a simple but effective way of telling time. All sorts of scientific and administrative ventures would be greatly helped by the introduction of such technology."
 dip_tech_cs_26_desc: "That expertise that allowed us to prop up clocktowers has now led to continual downscaling. At this point, accurate clocks have been made so small they can nearly fit in a pocket. Combined with hourglasses, we can keep much better track of business."
 dip_tech_cs_27_desc: "The University system is old by now, having spread from the East to European institutions like Bologna and Oxford. As they have accrued wealth and prestige, we can now modernize and formalize their curriculums, building more robust scholastic structures than the patchwork of unaffiliated colleges which dominated older learning."
 dip_tech_cs_28_desc: "Early English victories in the Hundred Years War saw a treaty which ceded extensive lands to the English crown. One of the understated effects of the war, however, was its contribution to the development of distinct English and French identities; and by extension the earliest conceptions of nation-states in general. To be English was now more than simply being a subject to the man holding that Royal title."
 dip_tech_cs_29_desc: "As Iberians explore such nearby islands as the Canarias and the Azores, there is a burgeoning interest in exploration for the sake of exploration."
 dip_tech_cs_30_desc: "Row row row your boat, gently down the stream..."
 dip_tech_cs_31_desc: "A Flute is a specialized cargo vessel capable of carrying a large load with a very small crew. Flutes were designed to be built cheaply and in large numbers. A useful ship if you need to move things across the oceans."
 dip_tech_cs_32_desc: "The first true ocean-going ship. Unlike galleys and cogs, Carracks can serve the role of proper ocean-going warships."
 dip_tech_cs_33_desc: "Republicanism is a novelty in its own right. But tying it to mercantile interests, such that the state operates almost in the same style? This is quite a sight to behold."
 dip_tech_cs_34_desc: "Interconnectedness is at an all-time high, and more reliable naval technologies have made long-range trade throughout the continent see a renaissance."
 dip_tech_cs_35_desc: "The concept of having official borders within which certain traders have to comply by our nation's regulations is quite novel, but it will ensure a slice of trade profits for the state."
 dip_tech_cs_36_desc: "Creation of legal and regional infrastructure in order to promote trade will not only encourage commerce but also allow us to better tax it."
 dip_tech_cs_37_desc: "Overseas trade is very risky but also highly profitable. The development of financial instruments like letters of credit will help reduce the risk, increasing our profits."
 dip_tech_cs_38_desc: "There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. So said Hamlet in the eponymous play, and so believe many of our contemporary philosophers."
 dip_tech_cs_39_desc: "As time progressed an expanding and increasingly advanced shipbuilding sector put new demands on seaports. Well maintained and planned docks went from being a convenience to a necessity for any location wishing to become a centre for naval or maritime activity."
 dip_tech_cs_40_desc: "With an extra boost to naval morale, our sailors will conquer the waves and rule the seas. While our colonists will be able to brave the dark corners of the world, founding new settlements farther from home than ever before."
 dip_tech_cs_41_desc: "Land transportation of a lot of cargo is simply too expensive, moving it by ship is more efficient. Building shipyards will provide enough ships to do so."
 dip_tech_cs_42_desc: "Development of the lateen sail allowed Carracks to sail much closer to the wind than earlier vessels. Enhanced maneuverability made them superior to other ships."
 dip_tech_cs_43_desc: "Arranging fleet basing rights with neighboring states and identifying specific havens in which to rest will extend the range of all ships we possess."
 dip_tech_cs_44_desc: "The best way to dip our fingers into trade profits is by rolling out more legislation, requiring traders both foreign and abroad to bear certain licenses and comply with certain regulations. Of course, only our government can supply the proper papers - for a fee."
 dip_tech_cs_45_desc: "The great wharfs and jetties will act as entrepôts for the world's goods. Let us build them and prosperity will follow."
 dip_tech_cs_46_desc: "Throughout the 16th century the increasing sailing ability of ships together with a growing number of more efficient guns have led to an increasing specialization of ship types. A Man of War is a ship dedicated entirely to sea warfare with a greater number of guns and ammunition than a ship that would also have to act as a Merchantman could ever hold. In the long run this development will lead to growing permanent navies and the development of naval tactics to better fit the new realities of sea warfare."
 dip_tech_cs_47_desc: "Galleys were light and small, and it was very difficult to mount cannons on them. The Galleass was a larger vessel capable of carrying a broadside of cannons like a man-of-war. To compensate for this extra weight, Galleass would be equipped with an additional sail."
 dip_tech_cs_48_desc: "Galleon was created by lowering the forecastle and elongating the hull. These changes in design improved the speed and stability of the ship which was of vital importance for Galleons to serve as better gun platforms."
 dip_tech_cs_49_desc: "The world is a big place and in order to develop our trade in it sometimes quite big risks must be taken. Luckily there are Merchants in our country that would be willing to do so, using mostly their own capital. By sanctioning such companies with a Government charter giving them special rights to exercise government powers as well as monopolies in certain areas we can control and encourage commercial development of everything from foreign trade contacts to our colonial possessions overseas."
 dip_tech_cs_50_desc: "In times past, sabotaging enemy cities and supplies via subterfuge was considered dishonorable. In the era of realpolitik, however, we cannot say the same. Let our spies infiltrate and destroy our neighbors' infrastructure."
 dip_tech_cs_51_desc: "With more and more countries sending their subjects or citizens abroad on various trading ventures and with so many living so close to each other for so long times it has become absolutely essential to have at least a basic concept of common laws of the seas. With publications such as 'Mare Liberum' or the later 'De Dominio Maris Dissertatio' the foundations to an international law of the seas has been laid."
 dip_tech_cs_52_desc: "Further development of transport ships led to construction of larger and faster vessels, which still tried to maintain the simplicity of construction of the Flute. These ships fell under the generic term Merchantman."
 dip_tech_cs_53_desc: "In order to make better use of the various developments in naval warfare new tactics are required. The evolution of broadside cannon have meant that the most efficient way for ships is no longer to seek to board the other party but rather to form a line of battle to be able to maximize the amount of firepower directed at the enemy."
 dip_tech_cs_54_desc: "The War Galleon, also known as a race-built Galleon, was built by reducing the number of decks on a Galleon. This sacrificed cannons for maneuverability, which proved to be beneficial in combat."
 dip_tech_cs_55_desc: "The Frigate is a ship built for speed and maneuverability. Just as the ancient Greeks were able to defeat their Persian invaders with the wind at their side, modern Frigates can slip past enemy galleons and intercept attackers."
 dip_tech_cs_56_desc: "Even at the beginning of the 17th century permanent navies were quite small and even naval powers of note would mostly maintain a naval force to meet their immediate needs. Over time however we are moving in the direction of a larger professional navy. Unless we want to see our rivals overtaking us in naval matters we must strive to create a larger permanent navy with an administrative structure to support it as well as ensure that a naval career can be a permanent occupation for our officers."
 dip_tech_cs_57_desc: "Originally developed by Barbary Corsairs, this galley didn't carry as many guns as a galleass, but it was smaller and far more maneuverable. This improved maneuver allowed it to be far more effective in combat."
 dip_tech_cs_58_desc: "In 1614 a rather mad physician wrote a treatise suggesting that scurvy was a result of a dietary problem and could be solved by consuming lemon or lime juice. As it turns out, there was method in his madness and we have started providing this new diet for our sailors. Other countries call us limey now."
 dip_tech_cs_59_desc: "The original frigate design described any ship that was built for speed and maneuverability. As the concept developed though, it became its own unique class of a ship designed to support ships of the line."
 dip_tech_cs_60_desc: "In today's weltanschauung, simply declaring your overlordship on sovereign lands and entities is frowned upon. We can bend the rules, however, by using Client States - puppet polities that bow to our influence."
 dip_tech_cs_61_desc: "A special version of the Frigate originally developed for operation in the Baltic. It kept a broadside of a frigate, but had a shallow draft and oars giving greater maneuverability in shallow waters, while sacrificing seakeeping in open oceans."
 dip_tech_cs_62_desc: "The addition of a third deck was a small sacrifice in maneuverability for a huge gain in close combat. The additional deck gave the ship an ability to fire onto the decks of smaller two-decker ships, while at the same time protecting its own deck."
 dip_tech_cs_63_desc: "The East Indiaman was the largest merchant ship built, it typically could displace in excess of 1,000 tons and measure over 175 feet in length. Those queens of the oceans were the most efficient way of moving men and cargo around the globe."
 dip_tech_cs_64_desc: "Life at sea is full of dangers and thus the punishments need to be harsh. If they do not have a sufficient deterrence effect, we will quickly run into trouble. Over time a system of highly public punishments has evolved, and now the time has come to formalize those. This will greatly enhance discipline at sea."
 dip_tech_cs_65_desc: "Alas, postcolonialism is still far off. Let us call this practice of agitating separatist sentiments in colonial and other subjected holdings metacolonialism - a recognition of these expansion methods as a distinct philosophical entity."
 dip_tech_cs_66_desc: "As trade grew, so did the risk. New ways of accumulating capital and managing risk needed to be developed. In Joint Stock Companies the risk of enterprise was shared among their many shareholders."
 dip_tech_cs_67_desc: "Originally the midshipman was a rank given to an experienced seaman who worked amidships. Men who aspired to become officers would often choose to serve in this role. If we formalize this, and make it a precondition for acquiring the rank of a commissioned officer, we will ensure our future leaders understand the ships they command."
 dip_tech_cs_68_desc: "A further reduction of risk came with the development of insurance. The ability for people to offset risk through payment of a small fee to an insurance broker allowed for further growth of trade."
 dip_tech_cs_69_desc: "Formalizing our treatment of treasonous and seditious activities in the modern legal sphere will go a long way in the interest of controlling state espionage."
 dip_tech_cs_70_desc: "Building ships that are slightly faster than those of our opponents, even if the amount of this extra speed is so negligible that it is of no military significance, can still fill our crews with confidence and make our enemy wary of taking us on in an even fight."
 dip_tech_cs_71_desc: "The ongoing trade deficit between Europe and China has caused a shortage of silver bullion in Europe and all over the world. Switching from silver coinage to gold coinage will allow new coinage to enter circulation and get trade flowing in ever greater amounts."
 dip_tech_cs_72_desc: "A predecessor to the Ironclad, protected cruisers bore armored hulls to save their delicate internal engine machinery from attacks."
 dip_tech_cs_73_desc: "Revolutions in steam power have opened up sea travel to the general public, and made the world a much smaller place. A business man can find himself in the Far East in a matter of days, while trade enterprises are at an all-time high."
 dip_tech_cs_74_desc: "The idea of armoring ships like a medieval knight would have seemed baffling centuries ago, but now it is a reality. Steel or Iron plating now protects ships from explosive shells and other such artillery."
 dip_tech_cs_75_desc: "Some romanticize the old days of sailships with cannons, Greek fire, or boarding action. Today, powerful gun batteries and churning steel engines send our floating behemoths around the wide oceans."
