 BIRTHPLACE_OF_INSTITUTION: "$PROV$ is the birthplace of §Y$NAME$§!"
 feudalism_date: "1000"
 investiture: "Investiture"
 desc_investiture: "In 1059 the Papacy established a College of Cardinals to self-ordain Popes by a purely clerical council, rather than allowing nobles to influence appointments. The Holy Roman Emperors were quick to try to preserve their rights of Investiture, however, over local bishops and abbots, setting in motion a violent conflict between Church and State. There is a silver lining to the growing unrest - a methodology of Investiture can eventually be worked out with the mutual consent of all parties, leaving a more sophisticated system of Religio-Social hierarchy in place."
 investiture_date: "1100"
 universities: "Universities"
 desc_universities: "Several universities claim to be the oldest in Europe, based on various criteria of measurement and semi-apocryphal records of when teaching began in their area. Regardless of who started first, by the end of the 12th century organized didactic institutions existed across the Western world, from Bologna to Oxford to Paris. Tutors and learned lecturers in theology, philosophy, classics, science, and other areas would impart their knowledge to new generations of young nobles, allowing for a dissemination of academic expertise around the continent. The phenomenon was not limited to Christian powers, as the Islamic world too had a long-established education system where some of the greatest minds of the Middle Ages tabulated their theories, taking influence from Asian and Indian expertise."

 guilds: "Guilds"
 desc_guilds: "With the rise of academic institutions, it is only natural that institutions of trade should abound as well, letting the bourgeoisie claim their own power alongside the landed gentry. Guilds were associations of merchants and craftsmen, centered around the structure of the City, often with the support of Royal decree. Growing out of post-conquest English law, guilds spread throughout Europe like wildfire in the twelfth and thirteenth century. The structure of the guild could be replicated on even larger scales, with entire cities banding together into similar leagues of cooperation. The 'Hansa', first mentioned as such in 1267, was a particularly powerful association of traders which controlled Northern European mercantile life for centuries."

 chivalry: "Chivalry"
 desc_chivalry: "Chivalric codes of knightly virtue have existed in some form for several centuries, but the 1300s saw them reach their height under such developments as the outbreak of the Hundred Years War. Off the battlefield, knights were encouraged to embody ideals of courtliness, service of the needy, piety, and fairness in competition. These ideals were encoded both in general social mores and in specific works of literature, which spread the romanticized concept of a knight far and wide."
 chivalry_date: "1300"
 publichealth: "Public Health"
 desc_publichealth: "A crisis has struck Eurasia, the likes of which have never been seen in human history. Priests and heathens, paupers and Emperors alike are mowed down by the thousands due to an invisible threat which looks like it may finally end the era of mankind. However, from the ashes, a newfound attention to public health has emerged. Drawing together the anatomic expertise of Islamic scholarship and Ancient Greek materialists, doctors roam the lands trying to minimize the damage and prevent further outbreaks of disease. Though they know nothing of the vectors which actually translate Bubonic Plague, certain strategies of quarantine and cleanliness have found currency in regions like Milan and saved them from apocalypse. These selfsame methods may pave the way for a better common weal at large in the years to come."
 publichealth_date: "1350"
 laytheology: "Popular Theology"
 desc_laytheology: "From the turmoil of Mongol invasions, the Hundred Years War, and the Black Death, new methods of approaching religion have emerged. The ball started rolling with figures like John Wycliffe and his Lollard heresy in England, but it wasn't until Jan Hus electrified the European continent that the true weight of populist theological movements was felt. With the clergy and laity both asking pointed questions about ancient traditions, the path lies open for more sophisticated religious hierarchies and secular reasoning. Even the stirrings of some larger reformation can be seen in the cries of street-preachers and God-inspired peasant armies."
 laytheology_date: "1400"
 industrialism: "Industrialism"
 desc_industrialism: "Steel, coal, great smokestacks and furnaces towering higher than the mightiest castle of the Middle Ages, or the richest palace of the Early Modern Era... now, building on Enlightenment scientism and continual revolutions in manufacturing technology, the world is embracing Industrialization. Rural populations flock to the cities to find work in new factories, while materiels are pumped out at an astonishing rate to support public and military demand. Not only has the landscape changed, but modes of thinking are shaped by the sudden presence of concrete and iron where pastoral vistas once abounded. Let the poets herald this marriage of mammon and muse!"
 industrialism_date: "1750"
 liberalism: "Liberalism"
 desc_liberalism: "At the turn of the nineteenth century, great political theorists like Adam Smith and James Madison influenced the world with their Liberal ideals, reaching an ever larger audience in the wake of unignorable revolutions in France and the Americas. Separation of powers, equal rights for all men and women, free market capitalism, an end to feudalism, even utopian socialism have all been put forth in the context of this new radical Liberal movement seizing Europe and beyond. Though the spectre looms large, all the powers of Old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise it: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies. It is high time that Liberals meet this nursery tale of the spectre of Liberalism with a manifesto of the ideology itself."
