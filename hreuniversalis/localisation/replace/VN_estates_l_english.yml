 holy_orders_estate_events.1.a: "Okay."
 holy_orders_estate_events.2.t: "Knightly Training Proves Successful"
 holy_orders_estate_events.2.d: "It has been a while now since we sent [Root.Heir.GetName] to the members of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ to educate [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] in their abilities. In [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] months of hard training, [Root.Heir.GetName] has not only seen a lot of the world, but has also been able to improve [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] administrative and fighting skills, culminating in an increased level of humbleness to our religion. We should sincerely thank the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ for taking care of the training of our [Root.Heir.GetTitle] so diligently and making [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] an exemplary knight."
 holy_orders_estate_events.2.a: "Reward them generously"

 holy_orders_estate_events.3.d: "Not only the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ takes over the administration of our provinces, but also the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName] excel by their modern methods. They particularly insist on preserving newly conquered territory so that they can take special care of the conversion of heretics and heathens.

 holy_orders_estate_events.4.d: "The $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ have gained considerable influence at the [Root.GetAdjective] court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] in the past years, often providing advisors to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and dominating state affairs today. Even the Holy Father himself has heard of this and has thus passed a decree granting a special position to the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$, freeing them from [Root.GetAdjective] jurisdiction and placing them directly under the authority of the Catholic Church. This means a massive intervention in our internal politics!"
 holy_orders_estate_events.4.a: "All right, then"
 holy_orders_estate_events.4.b: "We can't let that happen"
 holy_orders_estate_events.5.t: "Noble Knights"
 holy_orders_estate_events.5.d: "A serious dispute has broken out between the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ and the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName]. An influential knight, who is an excellent fighter not only in jousting, insists on being elevated to the rank of baron by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], as he, being a bastard, has no inheritance rights. While the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ support him in this - hoping for political advantages by doing so - the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ vigorously rejects this, as they fear for their own power. Whose side do we take?"

 holy_orders_estate_events.5.b: "We appreciate the concerns of our high nobility"
 holy_orders_estate_events.6.t: "Uncertain Pilgrimage to Jerusalem"
 holy_orders_estate_events.6.d: "A large group of [Root.GetAdjective] pilgrims wants to go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the Holiest City of Christianity. But the route to get there is many hundreds, if not thousands of kilometers long, often leading through rough terrain. To make matters worse, the pilgrims will probably have to cross lands where Christians are unwanted, possibly even persecuted. The $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName] however, offer to accompany the travellers to Jerusalem and protect them with their swords from potential danger."

 holy_orders_estate_events.7.d: "The relations between our court and the [Root.GetAdjective] $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ have become worse than ever. Quite blatantly, they are expressing their aversion to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and denying their loyalty to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. This is an outrageous affront to the feudal liabilities of [Root.GetName] and massively undermines our authority in the [Root.GetAdjective] bailiwicks. How can we defuse this situation?"
 holy_orders_estate_events.7.a: "Show them who's in charge"
 holy_orders_estate_events.7.b: "We mustn't aggravate the situation"

Therefore, the [Root.GetAdjective] $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ want to get permission from us to expand the existing hospice with a new infirmary in order to be able to continue fulfilling their charitable obligations."

 holy_orders_estate_events.9.d: "Many of the knights of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ have acquired renown beyond our borders through the past battles against our religious enemies they fought. In many places, the courage and bravery of our knights are appreciated, whose chivalrousness is also exceptional and outstanding. Verily, they reflect our entire nation's attachment to Christianity, making us all humble Christians."
 holy_orders_estate_events.9.a: "Deus Vult!"

 holy_orders_estate_events.10.d: "In recent years, the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName] have produced many great soldiers, advisors and administrators.

 holy_orders_estate_events.11.d: "These days, the future of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ in [Root.GetName] is uncertain, as their duties are mostly already entrusted to the [Root.GetAdjective] clergy or nobility. Their political influence has shrunk to the confines of their few hospices or bailiwicks, meaning that they enjoy almost no importance at our court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."

 mamluks_estate_events.4.t: "Conflict Between $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$"
 mamluks_estate_events.4.d.1: "It is well known that the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ of our nation come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Though they are often taken at a young age, they nevertheless form cliques, and we have now received word that the Turkish and Circassian $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ have come into conflict over their respective influence in court. A Turkish commander and a Circassian accountant each believe they deserve the position of Jashnkir, or 'Cupbearer', and unless we make a decision quickly this may spill over into bloodshed."
 mamluks_estate_events.4.d.2: "It is well known that the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ of our nation come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Though they are often taken at a young age, they nevertheless form cliques, and we have now received word that the Franji (European) and African $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ have come into conflict over their respective influence in court. An African commander and a European accountant each believe they deserve the position of Jashnkir, or 'Cupbearer', and unless we make a decision quickly this may spill over into bloodshed."
 mamluks_estate_events.4.d.3: "It is well known that the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ of our nation come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Though they are often taken at a young age, they nevertheless form cliques, and we have now received word that the Saqaliba (Slavic) and native Iberian $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ have come into conflict over their respective influence in court. An Iberian commander and a Slavic accountant each believe they deserve the position of Jashnkir, or 'Cupbearer', and unless we make a decision quickly this may spill over into bloodshed."
 mamluks_estate_events.4.a: "Side with the commander"
 mamluks_estate_events.4.b: "Side with the accountant"
 mamluks_estate_events.5.t: "Abuse of the Dhimmi"
 mamluks_estate_events.5.d: "Just as the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ are comprised of ethnic minorities, the religious minorities form an important part of our realm in their status as Dhimmi. They pay the jizya tax loyally and expect protection and tolerance in turn from the government. We have received complaints, however, that certain $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ began jeering at a group of infidel practitioners and ended up assaulting them in an all-out brawl. The Dhimmi collectively demand we address this outrage and punish the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ responsible."
 mamluks_estate_events.5.a: "Jail them"
 mamluks_estate_events.5.b: "Execute them!"
 mamluks_estate_events.5.c: "Who cares?"
 mamluks_estate_events.6.t: "Halqa and $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$"
 mamluks_estate_events.6.d: "The core of our military structure is the division between slave-soldiers and freeborn professional soldiers, known in Arabic as al-Halqa. In one of our recent campaigns, a group of experienced $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ suggested that we would be strategically better off with them having command precedence over their Halqa counterparts. There may be truth to this claim, but at the same time agreeing to the proposal would perhaps be granting the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ a dangerous amount of power."
 mamluks_estate_events.6.a: "We can keep them in line..."
 mamluks_estate_events.6.b: "Preserve the status quo"
 mamluks_estate_events.7.t: "Conspiracy Thwarted"
 mamluks_estate_events.7.d: "Succession in a Mamluk Sultanate is a complex and ambiguous issue. As such, different factions of [Root.GetMamluksName] frequently plotted against and assassinated reigning monarchs to install themselves into power. It was through this very method that the [Root.GetMamluksName] took over from their erstwhile lords in the first place. Word of just such a conspiracy has come to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], apparently headed by one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] old rivals.\nWhat should be done about this insolence?"
 mamluks_estate_events.7.a: "Execute the ringleaders"
 mamluks_estate_events.7.b: "Bribe them"
 mamluks_estate_events.8.t: "Unrest in the Barracks"
 mamluks_estate_events.8.d: "$ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ are usually sold to [Root.GetAdjective] traders at a young age, and from then on they are raised in barracks in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to be trained in the most advanced military arts. In theory their foreign origin keeps them disinterested in domestic power struggles, but in practice the opposite is often true. Apparently a contingent of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ has been causing trouble over food quality in the barracks and compelling their brethren toward disloyalty as well."
 mamluks_estate_events.8.a: "There is little we can do"
 mamluks_estate_events.9.t: "$ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ Conspire With Foreign Power"
 mamluks_estate_events.9.d: "Despite all their privileges, the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ never cease to feel resentment at their status. Throughout history there have been attempts to overthrow extant powers and establish new independent dynasties ruled by the descendants of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$. To this end, a certain cadre of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ has gone behind our back to work with one of our sworn enemies. These scoundrels have supplied the $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ with weapons for an insurrection against the state, which is set to launch immediately."
 mamluks_estate_events.9.a: "Curse them!"
 mamluks_estate_events.10.t: "A Grand Tournament"
 mamluks_estate_events.10.d: "The prestige of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ was tied to their patron and vice versa. $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ frequently would entertain themselves with sporting games involving martial prowess in addition to their weekly Furusiyya cavalry drills. The court has been asked to fund a grand demonstration that will show off $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ from the households of noblemen around the realm, though funding the usual Furusiyya shows already drains the state's coffers considerably."
 mamluks_estate_events.10.a: "Pay for the games"
 mamluks_estate_events.10.b: "We need the money"
 mamluks_estate_events.11.t: "Incorporation of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$"
 mamluks_estate_events.11.d: "Our recent military victories have led us to a quandary - what should be done with the hostile contingent of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ that is now at our mercy? If we incorporate them into our own ranks we can expect their loyalty, but at the same time, continual combination of $ESTATE_MAMLUKS$ into larger and larger groups could end up threatening the power of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 mamluks_estate_events.11.a: "Welcome them!"
 mamluks_estate_events.11.b: "Disband them"
 monopoly_privileges.11.d: "The monopoly on slaves we granted to the [Root.GetMamluksName] has expired, meaning that we are now able to reclaim the income from slave trading. However, the [Root.GetMamluksName] are keen to keep their privileges and are offering to pay us a lump sum in return for the monopoly being guaranteed for a further 10 years."

Having become comfortable in their grand appointments, these Asronan have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a series of demands. They require that certain administrative posts be entrusted to the Asronan by law, that Asronan customs become mandatory at court, and even that several of the highest ministerial offices be held by Asronan families in heredity.

Banditry has become so prolific that some cities have not received a single trade caravan in months.\n\nSeveral bandit leaders are seen as folk heroes by the local populace, bravely resisting the rule of the parasitic state of [Root.Country.GetName], founding new frontier towns, and recruiting local labor. Drawing into their ranks Zoroastrians and Muslims, toddy-tappers and smiths, the bandits have attracted widespread support.\n\nA direct military confrontation with the bandits would solve the immediate problem if we could root them out from their makeshift forts.

Merchants come from far off lands to purchase goods that we produce in abundance, but which to them are exotic luxuries.\n\nThe key to our success in these industries has been our patronage of various guilds who draw their membership from the Hutukhshan.

Our financial advisors see some commercial merit to these policies, but note that they entail granting an outrageous degree of autonomy to the provinces where the guilds are most powerful, essentially making them into merchant-princes. Refusing these demands would anger the guilds greatly, though it would go a long way towards curtailing their power."
 vaisyas_estate_events.10.d: "The Middle East is a dry and rugged land, requiring regular investment in its frontier settlements to be profitable to the state. Decades of neglect and a series of unexpected droughts in [drylands_province.GetName] have led to poor harvests, a steady decline in land revenue, and a trend towards migration away from the drylands and towards the wealthy cities of the coast.\n\nThe situation in [drylands_province.GetName] could however be reversed through the construction of canals and water tanks, ensuring enough water to allow the population to grow and for agriculture to expand. While this would end the stagnation in [drylands_province.GetName], it would draw our focus away from our coastal trading settlements.

Several of the most powerful Arteshtaran grandees have offered to wed their daughters into our line in exchange for a guarantee that they will continue to hold their ancestral lands and titles.

A particularly bold and ambitious scion of a notable clan has appeared at court on a quest to enhance the prestige of his kin. Approaching the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], he asks permission to settle [rajput_scion_province.GetName], where he shall found a new town.

The Arteshtaran at court have been thoroughly integrating into [Root.GetAdjective] aristocratic society, going so far as to learn the [Root.Culture.GetName] language, observe [Root.GetAdjective] courtly etiquette, and personally accompany the [Root.Monarch.GetName] wherever [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] goes. This is leading to the loss of a distinctly Arteshtaran voice at court, as these nobles have become more concerned with their personal advancement than in the interests of the Arteshtaran community."
 rajputs_estate_events.8.t: "The Arteshtaran Rebellion"
 rajputs_estate_events.8.d: "Relations between [Root.Country.GetName] and the Arteshtaran clans could hardly be worse. The marginalization of Arteshtaran nobles and the neglect of Arteshtaran soldiers has created an atmosphere of resentment and distrust that now threatens to erupt into violent conflict. Though it has become traditional for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to formally appoint Arteshtaran clan leaders, in the current state of crisis our preferred candidate has been unanimously rejected by his would-be subjects. The Arteshtaran of [Root.Country.GetName] now demand the right to appoint their own leadership, and to be left to govern their own affairs in provinces they control. They are prepared to install their chosen leader by force if we insist on maintaining our chokehold on dynastic politics."
 rajputs_estate_events.9.t: "Arteshtaran Daena"
 rajputs_estate_events.9.d: "The cornerstone of Arteshtaran identity is their Daena, which they derive from the moral guidance in their bardic writings. Every Arteshtaran leader must put kinship above all else, surrounding himself with a brotherhood of warriors and advisors all sharing descent from a patrilineal ancestor. Arteshtaran soldiers must fight and die in service to their masters; nothing but absolute loyalty is acceptable.\n\nRather than attempting to suppress these traditional Arteshtaran values and power structures, [Root.Country.GetName] has encouraged them, harmonizing them with service to the state and the [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The Arteshtaran see no contradiction between their Daena and their duty to us."
 rajputs_estate_events.11.t: "The Arteshtaran Aristocratic Diaspora"
 rajputs_estate_events.11.d: "Arteshtaran nobility has spread far and wide throughout the centuries, but a strong sense of kinship identity creates a common aristocratic culture. Arteshtaran chiefs know their status and history in relation to other Arteshtaran going back many generations.\n\nOur advisors, among them many Arteshtaran, suggest that these bonds could be exploited to the benefit of [Root.Country.GetName]. Most obviously, the Arteshtaran chiefs loyal to us could act as ambassadors to the Arteshtaran of nearby nations, enhancing our reputation in foreign courts.

They have been granted positions in the administration, control over Zanda pilgrimage sites, and preferential treatment in the taxation system. Our heavy patronage has at last paid off; they have offered us the service of a number of skilled financiers to aid our administration, and donated a large sum to our coffers. The workings of the state now run as smoothly as they ever have."

 jains_estate_events.8.d: "The holiest period of the religious calendar of many Zanda in [Root.GetName] has come. It is a time of fasting, austerity, and absolution. Members of the Zanda community use this time for prayer, meditation, and asking forgiveness from their fellows.\nZanda ministers employed in the [Root.GetAdjective] administration have petitioned the state to ask that the slaughter of animals be prohibited for the duration of this time. While a costly proposal for our butchers, it has been suggested that the state could make up for the loss of profit."
 jains_estate_events.8.a: "Prohibit animal slaughter for the next days."
 jains_estate_events.10.t: "Zanda Demand Religious Concessions"
 jains_estate_events.10.d: "Representatives of the [Root.GetAdjective] Zanda community appear before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a proposal; cement the status of Zoroastrian sects in both state and society in exchange for the undying loyalty of the community. They mean to achieve this status through the enactment of policies granting religious concessions. These would include the prohibition of animal slaughter, ending the confiscation of the property of the deceased, abolishing religious taxes, and the release of political prisoners with ties to prominent Zanda families.\n\nThese proposals have been met with outrage from the [Root.Religion.GetName] clergy, and are likely to be unpopular throughout the realm. It may be time to sever our close alliance with the Jains."

 marathas_estate_events.2.t: "Wuzurgan Poet Questions Asronan Authority"
 marathas_estate_events.2.d: "A great poet has emerged from among the Wuzurgan. Hailed as a living saint, the poet preaches equality before Ahura Mazda and defiance of caste restrictions. He writes of the Asronan:\n\n'Ahura Mazda’s servants have no caste,\nThe Yasna’s science so decrees.\nWhich of your books have saved the fallen?\nI know of none.'\n\nArguing that a man is only as chaste as his own faith and emphasizing personal salvation over ritual observances, his teachings have angered the Asronan of [Root.Country.GetName]. They demand that the poet must drown his works in the river and make a formal apology for his unorthodoxy."

 marathas_estate_events.3.t: "Dehqan Tactics"
 marathas_estate_events.3.d: "Facing an enemy that fields powerful artillery, our Wuzurgan advisors propose the adoption of a tactic that has served them well in the past. Focused on light and medium cavalry armed with lances and bows, it is a form of hit-and-run warfare that favors highly mobile cavalry flanking maneuvers. The smaller, lighter horses favored by them are ideal for such missions, able to outmaneuver cumbersome artillery, elephants, and heavy cavalry."
 EST_VAL_BARGIRS: "Enlisted Dehqan: §Y$VAL$%§!"
 marathas_estate_events.4.t: "Horses for the Dehqan"
 marathas_estate_events.4.d: "The Dehqan, Wuzurgan cavalrymen in [Root.Country.GetName]’s employ, traditionally have their horses provided for them by their patron. In recent months a decline in available mounts and a consequent rise in prices has made this a financially daunting prospect. The state could procure the necessary horses at an increased cost, but if the price proves unacceptable we may have to ask that the Dehqan meet the cost themselves."
 marathas_estate_events.5.t: "Militarization of the Wuzurgan"
 marathas_estate_events.5.d: "The Wuzurgan bring with them a hardened martial culture to the lands they rule. They maintain close ties with the peasantry and lower castes, favoring an egalitarian outlook over a belief in the inherent worth of nobility. Unlike many Persian armies, which typically draw their manpower from the ranks of the nobility, the Wuzurgan raise legions of peasant-soldiers skilled in guerrilla warfare. Though unendowed with the excellence of noble and illustrious birth, their martial experience makes them superior to the easy and effeminate troops of our enemies."
 marathas_estate_events.6.d: "The increasing militarization of the Wuzurgan has ecological drawbacks. Where the peasantry once tended the fields, they now stand to gain easy riches by serving half the year as soldiers. Labor shortages plus an increasing demand for warhorses are making traditional agriculture difficult and unprofitable, making the land more vulnerable to famines. Many are turning towards pastoralism; cattle can be herded with a smaller labor force, can be driven into forests during a drought, or hidden in ravines in times of war. It may be necessary to scale back militarization in [maratha_farming_province.GetName], though the peasantry is unlikely to receive this news well."
 marathas_estate_events.7.t: "Wuzurgan Develop Expensive Tastes"
 marathas_estate_events.7.d: "[Root.Country.GetName]’s campaigns in the Middle East have brought glory to the Wuzurgan that we entrust to lead our military. Many of these soldiers are returning home with a newfound taste for the luxuries of Arabic culture; Egyptian fragrances, Mesopotamian spices, elaborate works of brass and silver are now in high demand. As the Wuzurgan wield great influence in [Root.Country.GetName], the Wuzurgan nobility have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] asking for state patronage of these arts and procurement of exotic goods."
 marathas_estate_events.7.b: "We will not bankroll Arabic decadence."
 marathas_estate_events.8.t: "Khurramite Cult"
 marathas_estate_events.8.d: "A Zoroastrian sect centered around the Persian cleric Sunpadh has become popular among the Wuzurgan. Their members are known as Khurramites, occurring simultaneously across many settlements in Persia and remembering Babak Khorramdin who opposed Muslim rule in the 9th century. They wear symbolic red dresses, believe in reincarnation and promote the concept of free love, but still sharing many Zoroastrian principles.\n\nSome among the Asronan see these heretical spiritual movements as a threat to their religious authority. They seek to gain a measure of control over the Khurramites so that they can be integrated into orthodox Zoroastrian worship in accordance with their interpretation of Avestan ritual."
 marathas_estate_events.8.a: "The Khurramites shall remain free."
