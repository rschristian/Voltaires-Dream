 incident_investiture_controversy.1.t: "Pressure of the Pataria"
 incident_investiture_controversy.1.d: "Following the beginning of Papal efforts to institute ecclesiastical reforms, the Pataria, an ideologically motivated radical clerical movement, has acquired growing influence in several dioceses and monasteries in Lombardy. In recent weeks, they have ousted disagreeable priests and replaced them with clerics loyal to the Pope, further spreading the Papal will through the region.\nPressured into distress by rising political opposition, Archbishop Guido of Milan has urgently decided to send the episcopal vestments back to the Emperor and retire as a monk to a secluded monastery. However, before a new bishop was able to be elected legally, the Pataria seized the power of the bishopric and appointed a new archbishop themselves, eroding the Emperor's sole right of Investiture.\nIt is only a matter of time before the Emperor clashes with the reformist Papacy over ecclesiastical matters within the Empire."
 incident_investiture_controversy.1.a: "This shall not be our fight."
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.t: "The Investiture Controversy"
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.d: "Starting in the late 1050s, relations between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire became incredibly strained. The main conflict was between whether the Monarch or the Pope should have the right to appoint local bishops within their demesne.\nWith the election of [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] to the Holy See, an embittered opponent of the Empire was appointed head of the Church. Influenced by religious zeal and the conviction of supremacy of the papacy, this man will try to restore the freedom of the Church in face of the Empire."
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.a: "It is time to demonstrate the superiority of the Emperor."
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.tt: "The Investiture Controversy can be ended by the Emperor by selecting the respective peace option while using the '§MImperial Supremacy§!' casus belli against the §YPapal States§!.\n§RMeanwhile, the Emperor will suffer from reduced legitimacy, diplomatic reputation and papal influence.§!"
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.b: "The Pope shall be the supreme ecclesiastical head of the Empire."

 incident_investiture_controversy.2.c: "A fair compromise must be sought."
 incident_investiture_controversy.2.tt3: "§MThe Papacy will become an Elector.§!"
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.t: "The Two Swords"
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.d: "In order to avert a fragmentation of the Imperial Church, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has declared all claims to spiritual supremacy of the Pope as invalid. He hopes to ward off the papal clutches over ecclesiastical matters of the Empire by doing so.\nThis is the beginning of a protracted conflict that will put Catholicism and its principles to the test."
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.d2: "Already Charlemagne knew that he needed not only the approval of his entourage but also of the Church to be legitimized as Frankish Emperor.\nIn order to prevent conflicts with the Popes, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has recognized the papacy as spiritual head of the Holy Roman Empire, which, as the representative of God, is supposed to still stand above the Emperors themselves."
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.d3: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] was able to circumvent the question of who was the legitimate spiritual head of the Holy Roman Empire by a clever compromise that granted the papacy some privileges without taking too much power away from himself. Nevertheless, these concessions will enable us to exercise our ambitions on the Empire."
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.a: "Down with the Emperor's arrogance!"
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.b: "The only right choice."
 incident_investiture_controversy.3.c: "Ingenious decision."
 incident_investiture_controversy.4.t: "Pactum Calixtinum"
 incident_investiture_controversy.4.d: "In order to finally settle the Investiture Controversy that has dominated the politics of the Holy Roman Empire in the past decades, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] convened at a council in the city of Worms. Without any Emperor being able to completely subjugate and control the Papacy, the Emperor promised in public to acknowledge the Pope as spiritual head of the Empire permanently.\nIt is doubtful whether this arbitral award will effectively be able to settle the disputes between Emperors and Popes in the future."
 incident_investiture_controversy.4.a: "A severe setback for the Empire."
 incident_investiture_controversy.5.t: "The Fragility of the Papacy"
 incident_investiture_controversy.5.d: "After [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] had achieved several victories against Papal troops, [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] was unanimously forced by the Cardinals of the Curia to acknowledge Imperial Superiority. This defeat for the Papacy will preserve the independence of the Imperial Church and confirm the Emperor as one of the most powerful figures in Europe.\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether this peace between the two warring parties will actually last or escalate again."
 incident_investiture_controversy.5.a: "Hurray for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"
 incident_investiture_controversy.6.t: "The Excommunication"
 incident_investiture_controversy.6.d: "[PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has decided to excommunicate [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]! He claims the Emperor has been removed from the Church because he denies papal supremacy by continuing to appoint new bishops within the Empire. The Pope has also declared that the princes of the Empire are no longer vassals under the Emperor!\nIt has been made clear to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] that to escape the damning fate of excommunication, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will have to make a humiliating trek to Canossa – the current residence of [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] – as a gesture of peace to beg for forgiveness. Should we bow to the demands of the Pope and undertake such an embarrassing escapade?"

 incident_investiture_controversy.7.d: "[Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] [Emperor.Monarch.GetName] has undertaken the arduous and dangerous journey from the imperial capital to Italy, to beg for forgiveness in front of Pope [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Barefoot and only wearing a hair-shirt, the traditional garb of monks, [Emperor.Monarch.GetSheHe] asks for admission to the palace.\nApparently the [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] regrets [Emperor.Monarch.GetHerHis] recklessness in challenging the papal authority, but it might only be a vile ruse to lift [Emperor.Monarch.GetHerHis] excommunication."

Together they shared communion in the chapel of Saint Apollonio, officially ending the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s excommunication."
 incident_investiture_controversy.8.d2: "Although [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] remained for days outside the gates of Castle Canossa in bitter cold, he was eventually not granted an audience with [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName]. Degraded and still an excommunicated [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will embark on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] exhausting journey back home."

 incident_mediatization.1.t: "The Question of Mediatization"
 incident_mediatization.1.d: "The Holy Roman Empire has always been much less a centralized state than it has been a conglomeration of Prince-Bishoprics, Free Cities, Principalities, Duchies and Kingdoms alike. Due to the progressive reduction of imperial authority over the preceding centuries, the Theocracies and Free Cities have more or less been allowed to thrive despite a number of conflicts with the more expansionist monarchical states, and have retained their ancient privileges dating back hundreds of years while refusing to accept integration.\n\nHowever, radical changes to the Empire's structure are on the horizon, and ones largely of our own making. As we have expanded further and further into the Empire's borders, the question of how to compensate the dispossessed secular rulers of territory we have seized has become increasingly pressing. Giving the lands back and thereby compromising ourselves would be unacceptable to us; therefore, we must convince the Emperor that secularization of all Theocracies and mediatization of all Free Cities is the only option to preserve the Empire."

Our saving grace, however, has been the lavish privileges conferred on us by the Emperors in centuries past guaranteeing our rights. Yet now, our whole territorial integrity looks to be undone with outrageous demands from [From.GetName] being pushed on the Emperor to secularize all Theocracies in the Empire!"
