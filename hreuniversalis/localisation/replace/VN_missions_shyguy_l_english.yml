 vn_tou_conquer_barcelona_desc: "In 801, Barcelona was conquered by a Frankish army led by Guillaume de Gellone, Count of Toulouse. Charlemagne then founded a Catalan march to defend the borders against the Moors in Andalusia, creating a strong barrier state between the Umayyad Caliphate of Iberia and the Frankish Empire.

 vn_tou_secure_religious_peace_desc: "In the eyes of the Catholic Church, the Cathar movement is considered a heresy; their theological positions are viewed absurd, if not diabolical iniquity. Therefore, the Cathars were condemned and excommunicated for the first time by Pope Alexander III at the Third Lateran Council in 1179, prompting the suppression of the Cathars by the Catholic Inquisition. As a nation directly influenced by Catharism, we have to decide once and for all if we adopt the Catholic will or defend the Cathar Church with our lives."

It was only when a coalition of Franks and Burgundians defeated King Alaric II at the Battle of Campus Vogladensis in 507, sacking Toulouse, that the Visigothic power in Gaul started to collapse.

 vn_thu_kulturstadt_weimar_title: "Kulturstadt Weimar"
 vn_thu_kulturstadt_weimar_desc: "While cities like Prague or Vienna might symbolize omperial authority and are hearts of the Empire, none of these cities can claim the title of the 'Cultural Heart of Germany'. With great minds like Goethe and Schiller who made Weimar such an undisputable hub of literature and culture, it is no wonder that the classic era in Germany is oftentimes referred to as 'The Weimar Classic'. Weimar stands in the cultural heartland of literature and science and our reputation on the shoulders of giants like Goethe and Schiller."

#Taifa
 vn_missions.1.t: "Restoration of the Caliphate of Córdoba"
 vn_missions.1.d: "In 929, the Córdovan Caliphate was set up by the Umayyad dynasty after they had been overthrown by the Abbasid Caliphate in the east. The Umayyad Caliphs have then ruled most of the Iberian peninsula for nearly 100 years, until they were deprived of power by internal power struggles around the turn of the millennium. The Andalusian Fitna then began - the struggle of dozens of Taifas for supremacy on the peninsula.\n\nNow, we have triumphed after having subjugated the other taifas and united them under one banner. We are ready to reclaim the ancient Caliphate of Córdoba, and we still rule in the name of the Umayyads. We are now posed by the question of who shall lead this Caliphate?"
 vn_missions.1.a: "The current situation is just fine."
 vn_missions.1.b: "Step down in favor of an Ummayyad prince."
 vn_missions.1.c: "Marry into the Umayyad dynasty."
 vn_missions.1.dd: "Keep our republican system."
 vn_missions.1.e: "Our claim on the Caliphate has never been stronger than now."
#Florence
 vn_missions.2.t: "New Stocking of our Libraries"
 vn_missions.2.d: "For centuries, our books collections and libraries have provided our scholars, scientists and advisors with vast amounts of ancient and modern knowledge, driving them to new accomplishments. Thanks to the book printing that is now spread throughout Europe, it is possible for us to reproduce this knowledge with little effort. The possibilities are endless, but we have to decide which books to print first."
 vn_missions.2.a: "Philosophy has always fascinated us"
 vn_missions.2.b: "We can improve our diplomatic skills by learning from Roman statesmen"
 vn_missions.2.c: "Let us look ahead and explore modern warfare"
#Apulia
 vn_missions.3.t: "Sicilians under Foreign Rule"
 vn_missions.3.d: "For decades we have ruled over Italians, but our nobility and clergy largely remained of Norman culture. We are united in faith, but the cultural differences are tremendous, which constantly leads to tensions with the common people. To tackle this problem, we could try to spread our culture among the rural population as well, so that they slowly accept it and give up their own. Alternatively, we could abandon Norman customs and embrace Sicilian culture as primary culture."
 vn_missions.3.a: "Spread Norman culture intensively"
 vn_missions.3.b: "The days we used to call ourselves Norman are over"
#Latin Empire
 vn_missions.4.t: "Demands of the Venetians"
 vn_missions.4.d: "After the successful but costly crusade, our treasuries are strained and the Venetians demand reparations from us, although we have been their allies! We cannot afford to squeeze our scarce funds to greedy Doges, yet our advisors have proposed a solution to this. By stealing and melting down relics from Orthodox churches, we will be able to improve our financial situation and pay the Venetians. This would, however, make the Greeks dislike us even more than they already do."
 vn_missions.4.a: "Melt them down and turn them into money!"
 vn_missions.4.b: "The Venetians shall curb their greed!"
#Morocco
 vn_missions.5.t: "A New Caliphate!"
 vn_missions.5.d: "The destruction of the Fatimid caliphate and the conquest of Cairo by the Moroccan troops has not only stirred up the Muslim world. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] was due to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] recent accomplishments crowned as new Caliph of [Root.Religion.GetName] Islam by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] advisors, thus stepping into the footprints of Prophet Mohammad himself. The ambitious, mighty and faithful Empire of Islam stretching from al-Andalus to Egypt, born of descent from the caliphs of old pledges is to fight for the future of the peoples of Islam as a whole."
 vn_missions.5.a: "Let the infidels tremble!"
#Genoa
 vn_missions.6.t: "The Purchase of Chios"
 vn_missions.6.d: "Thanks to our excellent relations with [2341.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [2341.Owner.Monarch.GetName] [2341.Owner.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] in recent years causing our two nations to prosper, we have received a particularly promising offer: Due to their richness, the Aegean islands are often attacked by pirates, which is why [2341.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [2341.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has proposed the sale of the island of Chios to let us take care of its defence. We will be able to use it as a naval base, which will make it easier to perform own military operations in the future, but also as a trading hub, increasing our trade influence there.\nDo we want to be appointed commander of this island?"
 vn_missions.6.a: "Give them the money they demand"
 vn_missions.6.b: "Cancel the negotiations"
#Nicea/Epirus/Trebizond
 vn_missions.7.t: "The Reconquest of Constantinople"
 vn_missions.7.d: "For centuries, Constantinople, the Queen of all Cities, has been the center of Western culture, science and trade. Temporarily, hundreds of thousands of people lived in the metropolis, protected by the strongest city walls of the known world. It was not until the momentous Fourth Crusade that the city was for the first time expropriated from Greek hands; the Eastern Roman Empire was considered to have perished. However, thanks to our masterful diplomacy and successful campaigns, we were able to recapture the city that had once been regarded as impregnable. Now we have the choice to return to Constantinople and legitimize our rightful claim to the Roman heritage."
 vn_missions.7.a: "It is time for us to revert to Constantinople"
 vn_missions.7.b: "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is better suited as a capital for our ambitions"
#Thuringia
 vn_missions.8.t: "The Fate of Martin Luther"
 vn_missions.8.d: "With Catholic officials often showing corruption and greed when in power, some demand a change in the way of religion.\nOne of these people is the Augustinian monk Martin Luther, who was disgruntled with the policies of the Pope and cardinals, focused on amassing material wealth, wrote a paper containing 95 Theses on the wrongdoings of the Pope. He condemns the sale of indulgences and calls into question the righteousness of the Pope, who claims to be representative of God, yet acts quite unholy.\nThe hammer bangs of Luther against the Wittenberg Church pinning his works for everyone to see echoed through Europe and startled the Pope. Complex political relations make the affiliation with either Luther or the Pope not only a question about religion but power as well.\n\nNow this question arrives at our royal court and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is facing the question: either support Luther and become a beacon of Reformation, or sent him to trial for his blasphemy on Church and Pope."
 vn_missions.8.a: "Support Luther."
 vn_missions.8.b: "Have him stand trial for his blasphemy."
#Assyria
 vn_missions.9.t: "Religious Uncertainty"
 vn_missions.9.d: "Mesopotamia is considered a place where many different religions and beliefs are confronted with each other. Religious instability made our nation reconsider the path they are on. What faith shall govern our nation from now on?"
 vn_missions.9.a: "Choose the Church of the East."
 vn_missions.9.b: "Return to our ancient roots."
 vn_missions.9.c: "Find a suitable middle ground."
 vn_missions.9.dd: "Bow down to Allah."
 vn_missions.9.e: "Enforce the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith!"
 vn_missions.10.t: "The Church of the East"
 vn_missions.10.d: "After the Church of the East had detached itself from the 'Great Church' in the 4th century due to religious disagreements, it quickly transformed into the patron of the Christians of Mesopotamia. The Sassanid rulers promoted the Church of the East in order to maintain the loyalty of their Christian subjects and to create a contrast with the hostile Byzantium. The power of the Church of the East did not begin to fade even after the Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century, when missionaries spread the Nestorian faith to India and even China.\nWith the conquest of Baghdad, the seat of the Patriarch of the Church of the East, the time has come for us to decide its fate. Do we want to promote, restrict or even destroy it?"
 vn_missions.10.a: "The current situation is fine."
 vn_missions.10.b: "Come to an understanding with the Church."
 vn_missions.10.c: "Demand full autonomy."
 vn_missions.10.dd: "Abolish the Church."
 vn_missions.11.t: "Return of the Israelites"
 vn_missions.11.d: "After the Black Death had lied waste to Europe, a lot of Jews were expelled from their homes. In the hope for a better future, many travelled to the home they desired to return to the most, hoping that the current [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName] is more tolerant than the Assyrian Empires of the past. However, this is up to us to decide."
 vn_missions.11.a: "Allow them to settle in Judah."
 vn_missions.11.b: "Disperse them all over the [Root.GovernmentName]."
 vn_missions.11.c: "Take their money and tell them to leave."
 vn_missions.11.dd: "Allow them to settle as Dhimmi."
#Byzantium
 vn_missions.12.t: "Regnum Bospori"
 vn_missions.12.d: "Thanks to successful campaigns in recent years, we were able to claim the other side of the Black Sea coast for ourselves. Since this region was already ruled by a Roman client state in Roman times, the question now arises whether we should relinquish the local administration in order to focus our attention on other regions of our Empire."
 vn_missions.12.a: "Appoint a viceroy"
 vn_missions.12.b: "We do not need a client state"
#Valencia / Tortosa / Dania
 vn_missions.13.t: "The Rise of the Saqaliba"
 vn_missions.13.d: "The so-called Saqaliba represent the portion of our Mamluks who are descended from the South Slavic peoples of the Balkans. This caste has produced many great men in recent years and has been instrumental in our political advancement, even shaping court life at in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\nWe are now faced with the question of whether to take a bold path and entrust the rule of [Root.GetName] to these determined and ambitious men...?"
 vn_missions.13.a: "They are to rule."
 vn_missions.13.b: "These scoundrels are not of noble blood!"
 EST_VAL_SAQALIBA_RISE: "Rise of the Saqaliba"
 EST_VAL_SAQALIBA_DECLINE: "Decline of the Saqaliba"
#Sardinia
 vn_missions.14.t: "Regnum Sardiniae et Corsicae"
 vn_missions.14.d: "In the year of our Lord, [GetYear], the Pope has come to a decision regarding the fate of Sardinia. Thanks to our diligent guidance, he has come to make a wise choice: the duchy of Sardinia shall be ruled by its natives and its natives alone, and [Root.Monarch.GetName], duke of Sardinia and Corsica, shall be their ruler."
 vn_missions.14.a: "Excellent news!"
#Sardinia-Piedmont
 vn_missions.15.t: "The Papal States evicted from Romagna!"
 vn_missions.15.d: "Has the Lord forsaken us? Today, in the year $YEAR$, the armies of [From.GetName], devil's kith and kin, have overrun our rightful territories in Romagna. While we will without any doubt effortlessly take it back from those brutes, this will greatly affect our diplomatic reputation."
 vn_missions.15.a: "Infidels!"
#Georgia
 vn_missions.16.t: "The Future of the Armenian Church"
 vn_missions.16.d: "The Armenians have always been adherents of Miaphysite Christianity, which split off from the rest of Christianity in the 5th century. Consequently, the important question now arises as to how we will deal with these alleged heretics in our conquered territories.\nAn option might be to keep the Armenian Apostolic Church as an equal institution in our state and allow the Armenians to continue to practice their faith. Alternatively, we will opt for a much more radical course, namely the dissolution of the Armenian Church to enable the [Root.GetAdjective] Church to put out its feelers to Armenia, which will certainly cause unrest among our Armenian subjects though. With sufficient finesse, we might instead strike a balance by slowly starting to integrate the Armenian ecclesiastical institutions into our own, thereby merging the two Churches in the long run. What do we choose, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 vn_missions.16.a: "Maintain an independent Armenian Apostolic Church"
 vn_missions.16.b: "Extend the influence of the [Root.GetAdjective] Church"
 vn_missions.16.c: "Strive for integration into the [Root.GetAdjective] Church"
 vn_missions.16.a.tt: "Every owned province with §YArmenian§! culture gets '§YArmenian Church Preserved§!' for §Y30 years§!, giving the following effects:\nLocal Institution Spread: §G+20.0%§!\nLocal Tax Modifier: §G+15.0%§!\nLocal Missionary Strength: §R-2.0%§!"

#Cologne
 vn_missions.17.t: "New Electoral Residence?"
 vn_missions.17.d: "The patricians of Cologne are disturbed by the duties and taxes that we levy on the roads and streets along the Rhine. Since our secular possessions now extend far beyond the banks of the Rhine, we could expand a more distant city into a new residential city. In this way, we will shift our political and economic focus in order to weaken the rebellious people of Cologne."
 vn_missions.17.a: "It is not far from Cologne to Bonn"
 vn_missions.17.b: "Arnsberg is a lovely town, isn't it?"
 vn_missions.17.c: "We do not need a new capital"
 vn_missions.18.c: "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is my favorite as a matter of course"
 vn_missions.18.t: "The Shrine of the Three Kings"
 vn_missions.18.d: "Thanks to our great political importance in the Holy Roman Empire, the Emperor has given us a magnificent gift: the Bones of the Three Magi. These unique relics will certainly attract thousands of pilgrims to Cologne to praise the Lord every .\nOur advisors are sure that our old Cathedral will not be able to handle these expected crowds. Let us therefore begin with the construction of a new Cathedral, which will surpass all previous church towers by far and will demonstrate our unlimited prestige!"
 vn_missions.18.a: "Lay the foundation of a new Cathedral"
#Teutonic Order & Livonian Order
 vn_missions.19.t: "Großschäfferei of [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 vn_missions.19.d: "When the Prussian and Livonian cities joined the Hanseatic League in the 14th century, the Teutonic Order became one of the largest long-distance traders of the Hanseatic sphere. With the aim of benefiting economically from trading, commercial procedures of the Order were optimized by the establishment of the office of the 'Großschäffer'.\nWith our constantly growing economic strength, we should decide which scope of our trade we want to entrust to the Großschäffers."
 vn_missions.19.a: "Focus on domestic trade"
 vn_missions.19.b: "Focus on foreign trade"
 vn_missions.20.t: "A Baltic Adventure"
 vn_missions.20.d: "Many pious knights from Western Europe want to support our Crusade against the Balts and have joined our armies."
 vn_missions.20.a: "We still carry the Cross!"
#Venice
 vn_missions.21.t: "Carta Concessionis"
 vn_missions.21.d: "To secure Venetian control of the distant island of Crete, we should consider distributing it to Venetian knights and burghers who will be led by a feudal duke. This would not only allow us to keep the local population in check, but also to promote the development of the island and our trade influence in the eastern Mediterranean Sea."
 vn_missions.21.a: "Assign the island to a duke"
 vn_missions.21.b: "We keep control of Crete ourselves"
#Qahira
 vn_missions.22.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Resistance"
 vn_missions.22.d: "The Mongolian Empire is expanding uncontrollably to the west, and no army, no general has ever been able to stop those fierce horsemen. However, the great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has sworn not to leave [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects to the Mongols without resistance - something dozens of other rulers have desperately failed to achieve before.\nWe know exactly that the dreaded warriors of the Mongols are marching towards [Root.Capital.GetName] at that very moment, scorching every village and farm they meet as well as robbing, raping and slaughtering our people on their way. The coming battles might appear to be hopeless, but at the same time we know that only we have the chance to vanquish the nimbus of Mongolian Invincibility!"
 vn_missions.22.a: "To arms!"
#Toulouse
 vn_missions.23.t: "Principality of Toulouse"
 vn_missions.23.d: "In the past, the French Kings often tried to restrict the autonomy of the Occitan rulers and to bind them more closely to the French Crown. With our growing influence within the French Kingdom, however, we have been able to maintain our sovereignty, causing many counts and dukes of Occitania to look up to us with awe.\n\nThe influence of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has now grown to such an extent that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can easily compete with the French King for supremacy in southern France and beyond. Consequently, the question arises whether we want to throw off the French yoke once and for all and proclaim our own principality, or whether we want to remain subjects of the French Monarch."
 vn_missions.23.a: "Proclaim the Principality of Occitania!"
 vn_missions.23.b: "Proclaim the Principality of [Root.GetName]!"
 vn_missions.23.c: "We stay loyal to the [Root.Overlord.GetAdjective] [Root.Overlord.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 vn_missions.24.t: "The White and Black Brotherhoods"
 vn_missions.24.d: "The Cathar religion is spreading inexorably in Occitania. The opposing doctrines and teachings are constantly widening between the Catholic Church and the Cathar Church, causing more and more tensions between the religious groups.\n\nIn [cathar_center.GetName], a center for the Cathar religion, a militant Brotherhood has been established whose members are commited to fighting the Cathars by seizing or destroying their property. To oppose this so-called 'White Brotherhood', a counter-movement has quickly formed, the 'Black Brotherhood'. Daily, the two parties are clashing, banners flying, bristling with weapons, even with cavalry in evidence. It is clear that the Brotherhoods will soon spill over into surrounding cities and communes, posing a threat to religious peace not only in our [Root.GovernmentName], but also to other rulers.\n\nNeither Catholic bishops, nor Cathar bishops are willing to mediate between the two factions, making it impossible to restore order in [cathar_center.GetName]. So it is now in the hands of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide which of the two brotherhoods will earn [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] loyalty, and which will have to take a step back."
 vn_missions.24.a: "Side with the White Brotherhood."
 vn_missions.24.b: "Side with the Black Brotherhood."
 vn_missions.24.c: "Expel the White Brotherhood and encourage Catharism!"
#Swabia
 vn_missions.25.t: "Hoffest of Mainz"
 vn_missions.25.d: "Thanks to our recent political and military successes, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has called for a court festival. Within a few weeks, a veritable city of tents and wooden buildings, dominated by an impressive palace and church, was erected in Mainz, a central city in the Kingdom of Germany. Nobles and clergymen flocked to Mainz from Germany, France, Spain, England and Italy in order not to miss the coming spectacles. After a sumptuous banquet, which did not only offer local dishes but also culinary specialties from far exotic places, the youngest offsprings of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] were accoladed, thus securing the succession of [Root.GetName]. This was followed by a riding event where the best knights of the continent could demonstrate their skills in swinging lances, banners and shields. While the guests were enjoying for days, the most important rulers of Europe fulfilled their political duties by breaking or concluding treaties.\nThis opulent festival will be remembered for decades to come, illustrating [Root.GetName]'s glorious prestige!"
 vn_missions.25.a: "Splendid!"
#Poland
 vn_missions.26.t: "A Dukedom in Prussia?"
 vn_missions.26.d: "The subjugation of Prussia raises the question of how we want to organize the administration and government of the region. The long coastline, with its shipyards and trading posts, would certainly benefit the [Root.GetAdjective] Crown if it was directly under its control, but we might prefer to invest our capacity in more important parts of the [Root.GovernmentName]."
 vn_missions.26.a: "Appoint a Prussian duke"
 vn_missions.26.b: "Keep the territories for ourselves"
#Lithuania
 vn_missions.27.t: "Christian Missionaries"
 vn_missions.27.d: "The Lithuanian tribes have always trusted in their own pantheon of gods, led by Perkunas, the God of Thunder. In recent years, however, strange missionaries have come to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] several times, where they have tried to convert our people to their faith - Christianity. They believe in Jesus Christ, whose sacrificial and holy deeds are written down in a Holy Book called 'Bible'. After Jesus had been crucified as the alleged 'King of the Jews', he is said to have risen from the dead, whereupon Christianity became the predominant religion in Europe in the following centuries.\n\nWith the unification of the Lithuanians and the establishment of our own duchy, our Christian neighbours have shown an enhanced interest in us. We have already heard of the stories of the so-called Crusades - Holy Wars - which Christians waged against pagans in order to force them to convert. Perhaps we will also have to fight against the Christians if we continue to refuse to adopt Christianity."
 vn_missions.27.a: "Hire a Catholic bishop to baptize [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]"

 vn_missions.28.d: "We control large parts of the sparsely populated Ruthenia only loosely, which is often raided by Turkmen plunderers from the eastern steppes. In order to protect the region against these assaults and to colonize it, we should consider transferring these lands to the Cossacks who live in our [Root.GovernmentName]. These 'free men' are experienced steppe warriors, who have often supported us in military matters, but are a headstrong people in their own right. However, if we can secure their loyalty, they will surely emerge as powerful subjects and allies."

 vn_missions.29.t: "Paradisus Judaeorum"
 vn_missions.29.d: "The history of Judaism in Poland dates back to the 10th century, when Jewish merchants regularly visited Polish cities via trade routes and later settled in them. The religious intolerance caused by the Crusades brought many Jews from France, Germany or Spain to Poland, where the Polish kings offered them protection. Boleslaw III recognized the utility of Jews in the development of the commercial interests of his country, turning them into the backbone of Polish economy. Jews also worked as engravers and technical supervisors at the Polish court, enjoying undisturbed peace and prosperity.\n\nWe could continue this tolerant policy of our successors by allowing the establishment of a new autonomous Jewish community in the city of [new_jewish_community.GetName]. In return for their religious freedoms and privileges, we will certainly benefit from their ingenuity by allowing them to collect taxes and provide education in that province. How do we decide this time, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 vn_missions.29.a: "Establish a new Qahal in [new_jewish_community.GetName]"

 vn_missions.30.d: "In the early 11th century, the former Salian Emperor Conrad II commissioned the construction of a majestic cathedral in Speyer, which is to tower above all the churches built to date. Such a prestigious undertaking requires decades of work, hundreds of architects and builders, as well as enormous amounts of money and building materials.\nWe are proud to announce that the final construction phase of the Speyer Cathedral has been completed under [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The outstanding splendour and glory of this Christian monument will cause the princes and bishops of the Empire to go green with envy. Even the Pope himself will be stunned and impressed by this incredible demonstration of power.\nShould we organize a new consecration appropriate to the dimensions of the impressive Cathedral?"

 vn_missions.34.t: "Printing Press of Leipzig"
 vn_missions.34.d: "After Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press around 1440, the Lorraine merchantman Konrad Kachelofen founded one of the first printing houses of Europe in Leipzig. Starting in 1483 at the latest, he worked as a bookseller, publisher and printer until 1516. His printing works were extensive and varied in content, so he worked not only for the University of Leipzig but also for the diocese of Meissen. He printed the common theological and philosophical writings of medieval authors, contemporary humanists, as well as dictionaries and textbooks and classical texts of the great writers like Plato, Ovid and Seneca. Some German-language titles, such as the sermons of German priests, also originated from his office. Even after Kachelofen, the Leipzig book printing house continued to maintain an influential position in northern Germany, with mass production of Reformation literature, which eventually contributed to Lutheranism becoming the predominant religion in Saxony and beyond."
 vn_missions.34.a: "Great!"
#Austria
 vn_missions.35.t: "Religious Policy"
 vn_missions.35.d: "The Reformation has not only divided [Root.GetName] into two rival factions of faith, but also the entire Holy Roman Empire, where Catholics, Protestants and other Christian heresies tried to gain the upper hand. In such times we cannot afford to pursue changeable religious policies. Therefore, we have to determine once and for all how [Root.GetName] should behave towards the different Christian denominations in the future, so that our nation can pursue a consistent foreign policy."
 vn_missions.35.a: "Our subjects are free to choose their faith themselves"
 vn_missions.35.b: "Rather rule a desert than a country full of heretics"
 vn_missions.36.t: "Privilegium Maius"
 vn_missions.36.d: "Unjustifiably, our splendid [Root.GovernmentName] has never received imperial privileges, including the electoral dignity. We are thus limited to the rank of a duchy, which, however, is not adequate for our outstanding prestige. Based on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] \nexemplary wisdom, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] had the brilliant idea of having the necessary documents of former Emperors forged, with which we could claim additional privileges from the Emperor. With these special rights, we will ascend to become the most powerful prince behind the Emperor and the seven Electors."
 vn_missions.36.a: "Austria is destined to rule the world"
 vn_missions.36.b: "Well, why don't we just elevate ourselves to an Archduchy?"
 vn_missions.37.t: "Viceroyalty of Lombardo-Venetia"
 vn_missions.37.d: "Our Empire has now grown to a gigantic scale, with [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] as the central figure and absolute ruler. However, many people in our possessions in Italy do not accept [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], demanding one of theirs as ruler of Italy.\nWe should consider putting our Italian territories under the rule of a viceroy or governor who keeps the Italian people at bay while we focus on other regions of our Empire."
 vn_missions.37.a: "A viceroy can better control the people there"
 vn_missions.37.b: "We prefer to rule Italy directly"
#Ingria
 vn_missions.38.t: "Ingrian Port"
 vn_missions.38.d: "As of recently, large amounts of merchants, from both West and East, have been flocking to our newly-established trading hub, seeking a way to get around the monopoly Novgorod has on the fur trade. Novgorodian merchants have also arrived, seeking to control the waterways into their territory. Both factions are beginning to complain of increased competition, petitioning us to remove the others. Perhaps we could take advantage of this, and allow merchants we deem acceptable to stay, and those subversive to us to be prohibited."
 vn_missions.38.a: "The Western ones love furs!"
 vn_missions.38.b: "We could try to work with Novgorod..."
 vn_missions.38.c: "Let the merchants fix this themselves!"
#Franche Comte
 vn_missions.39.t: "Pope Callixtus II"
 vn_missions.39.d: "It was common practice in medieval Europe for fourth or fifth sons to join the Church. This was oftentimes their best option as they would have little or no chance to receive a significant inheritance. One of such cases was the fourth son of Count William I of Burgundy, Guy, who joined the Church and became Pope Callixtus II. As pope, he ended nearly 50 years of war between Rome and the Imperial crown in what became known as the Investiture Controversy. This was a disagreement between who could appoint bishops, the Church or the Empire. Callixtus compromised that clergymen would swear loyalty to the Emperor but would be appointed by the Church."
 vn_missions.39.a: "God bless [Root.GetName]! Europe is lucky to have such a productive nation."
 vn_missions.39.b: "We should be humble about our accomplishments."

 vn_missions.40.t: "The Crusade of Barbastro"
 vn_missions.40.d: "Facing the constant threats of the Muslim Taifas towards their Christian neighbours, [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has publically called for a Crusade against the Moorish invaders, speaking of a Christian emergency. The Papal appeal spread rapidly throughout Catholic Europe, and countless princes and bishops soon gathered their knights to support the Christian kingdoms of Iberia in their ceaseless and exhaustive wars.\nNow, they are altogether marching across the Pyrenean Mountains to reach the only slightly fortified and defended borders of the Taifas in the east, ready to conquer the unprotected fortresses and cities."
 vn_missions.40.a: "To battle!"
 vn_missions.41.t: "Victory at Barbastro"
 vn_missions.41.d: "The Crusaders, who set out from France, Burgundy and Italy to Iberia to fight the Moorish Taifas in the east, have been victorious!\nIn a spectacular battle at Barbastro, the knights defeated the unorganized forces of the Muslim Taifas, quickly reducing their remaining defenses to nothing. This day will not only seal the beginning of the Christian Reconquista, but will inspire all devout Christians to fight against faithless tyrants.\nChristendom shall hail [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] for his great wisdom eternally!"
 vn_missions.41.a: "¡Santiago y cierra España!"
 vn_missions.41.tt: "When fighting Muslim Taifas, Christian countries of Iberia will receive a bonus during the next §Y50§! years."

 vn_missions.42.d: "The Crusaders, who set out from France, Burgundy and Italy to Iberia to fight the Moorish Taifas in the east, have failed!\nIn a disastrous battle at Barbastro, the Moors defeated the unorganized forces of the Crusaders, quickly reducing their remaining reinforcement to nothing. The hope of many Christians of ever regaining all of Iberia for Christendom has been dashed this shameful day, and the Angels will weep for the fallen soldiers.\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], who ordered the expedition to Barbastro, will have to bear responsibility for that day."
 vn_missions.42.a: "We have disappointed Matamoros."
 vn_missions.43.t: "Corruption in the Electoral College"
 vn_missions.43.d: "Recently, many diplomats and dignitaries of the Electors of the Holy Roman Empire, who were stationed at our court, abruptly departed with haste and resentment. When we learned a little later that our own envoys sent to the Electoral courts had been forced to leave, we knew that this could not be a coincidence and that there must be a reason for it.\n\nOur agents and spies have traced the trail of these highly suspicious events, returning to our court with unpleasant news: Apparently, [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has interfered in the internal affairs of the Empire unjustifiably and persuaded the Electors to turn away from [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], the House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] and our recent policies through disgraceful bribery and blackmail.\n\nPersuading the Electors to elect [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s heir as next Holy Roman Emperor will particularly become a difficult task for us."
 vn_missions.43.a: "Pernicious and scornful!"
 vn_missions.44.t: "Christian Missionaries at the Mongolian Court"
 vn_missions.44.d: "An envoy from faraway Europe has arrived at our court, bringing with them rich chests and exotic goods. They claim to want to expand the cultural and scientific exchange between us Mongols and them Europeans, for which they propose us to convert to their faith - Christianity.\nShould we welcome the Christian missionaries into our realm, or repel them?"
 vn_missions.44.a: "This is a brave but promising idea."
 vn_missions.44.b: "We must not lose our syncretism to false priests."
#Huns/Khazaria
 vn_missions.45.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Judaism"
 vn_missions.45.d: "Judaism is an ancient and elevable religion, but it comes with the great disadvantage that our neighbors regard us as infidels. We should consider abandoning the Jewish faith for good."
 vn_missions.45.a: "We will be a new Jewish homeland."
 vn_missions.45.b: "The state is Jewish but that should not impact the common man."

 vn_missions.45.e: "We should convert to Islam."
#Andalusia
 vn_missions.46.t: "The Revival of Damascus"
 vn_missions.46.d: "The city of Damascus has once been the capital under the first Umayyad Caliphate and has recently been restored under our guidance. There are some in our midst who have been believing for long for a return to this ancient city as it would be vital for our continued expansion into the east. While others argue that our capital in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is a far more suitable, being better defended and closer to the real front in Gaul and Italy."
 vn_missions.46.a: "Side with the Traditionalists."
 vn_missions.46.b: "Side with the Conservatives."
 vn_missions.47.t: "Emirate of Crete"
 vn_missions.47.d: "The Emirate of Crete was a pirate state that has harassed the Roman Empire for a long time being. They have been decently successful during their time, however, the Abbasid Caliphate was unable to protect them.\nThere are those who are calling for the re-establishment of this Emirate to harass the Roman and Greek shores once more but this time under stronger protection."

They promise to protect us against the Christian treat and respect our autonomy in their [From.GetGovernmentName]. However, if we were to reject their generous offer, they warn us that we will not get such a chance again.\nAre we to accept them as rulers of al-Andalus or should we rebel against their dominion?"
 vn_missions.49.a: "Accept their offer."
