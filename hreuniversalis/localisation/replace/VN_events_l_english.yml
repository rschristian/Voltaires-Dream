 aow_events.377.t: "The Cause of the Anabaptist Plague"
 aow_events.377.d: "Normally, each nation's rabble is their own concern. Not so when another nation openly espouses the same spiritual rot as the rabble. Many among both the clergy and military draw a straight line between the Anabaptist revolters we fight today and the dedication to the Anabaptist cause shown by our neighbors. We cannot remain a respected and feared nation in the eyes of others if we do not confront them about their support, explicit or implicit, of the heretics who assault the [Root.GetAdjective] lands."

Under normal circumstances, he would be very unlikely to grant such a request, however, if we can leverage some of our influence over him, the Pope might have no option but to say yes."
 consort_events.201.db: "As devout [Root.Religion.GetName]s, the only way to end a marriage is to request a special dispensation from the Pope. It is almost unheard of that he would grant such a request. If we only had some influence with him, perhaps we could have leveraged it to change his mind, but it turns out that we are without power in this situation."

 culture_religion_events.2.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] and the [Root.Culture.GetName] people"
 culture_religion_events.2.db: "The ascension of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been less than well received by the [Root.Culture.GetName] people. They consider [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] manners foreign and strange. While some distrust to a new ruler is only natural it seems that for the time being our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will mostly have supporters at court, where [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] surrounds [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] with [Root.new_ruler_religion.GetReligionName] friends from foreign lands."
 devotion_events.10.dd: "A key element of our succession is the relationship between the master (Murshid) and student. It took much training, but [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has succeeded in making [Root.Heir.GetName] efface [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] former life of noble decadence and fully embrace the ascetic tenets of our state."
 devotion_events.11.dd: "When a neighboring noble sent his child to be the student of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], he probably expected to never hear from [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] again. Yet [Root.Heir.GetName] has already succeeded in spreading the word of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] Murshid far and wide, including in [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] home nation."
 devotion_events.12.dd: "Some were skeptical at the choice of a rich merchant's son as the designated successor to [Root.Monarch.GetName], but many of the greatest ascetics - indeed, Prophet Muhammad himself! - were originally merchants. [Root.Heir.GetName] has proven [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] worthiness by donating all of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] riches to the fisc."
 devotion_events.13.dd: "Sufism and Islamic mysticism in general is founded on the back of learned philosophers like al-Ghazali, ibn Arabi, Hasan al-Basri, and Jalaluddin Rumi. Our heir [Root.Heir.GetName] has followed in the footsteps of these philosopher-mystics by studying the great works of the ancient Greeks translated into [Root.Culture.GetName]."
 devotion_events.14.dd: "The choice of a charismatic preacher like [Root.Heir.GetName] as the successor to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was a natural one, as Sufi tariqas have always relied on the forceful personalities of their Murshids and Marabouts. A good preacher can inspire the Ummah toward zakat - almsgiving - like nobody else."
 dutch_republic.14.db: "The Statist rulers have succeeded in making institutions of [Root.GetName] increasingly representative, but one institution that has resisted recent changes is the army. One of our generals belongs to a family of nobles who have strong ties to the House of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] and has been sabotaging our efforts to oust the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] loyalists from high-ranking military positions.\n\nNow, he's gone even further and wants one of his relatives, also a Monarchist, to act as advisor to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. While this young person seems like a talented commandant, we would loathe giving them influence."

Even long after the Popes and Emperors resolved their differences and open warfare died down throughout the Italian peninsula, the cultural division would remain, forcing ambitious states to side with one set of interests or the other. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must choose which faction to cast [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] lot with, and beware the consequences of the inevitably angered opposing faction."

#Abbacies
 abbacy_events.1.t: "Communal Outreach"
 abbacy_events.1.d: "Monastic life is often based around isolation, with some traditions even advocating the complete separation of brothers or sisters aside from specific meeting times. A prior has approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a proposal for more outreach, though it is up to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide where these attentions should be directed.\n\nThe monastic charter demands attention to other suffragan or parent houses, except in cases of severe sickness; but there is also an implicit obligation to attract righteous followers to become new monks or lay-servants."
 abbacy_events.1.a: "Inter-monastic"
 abbacy_events.1.b: "Local"
 abbacy_events.1.c: "We are better off alone!"
 abbacy_events.2.t: "Newly Arrived Converts"
 abbacy_events.2.d: "The child of a local noble has come to our gates asking for entry into the monastic life. A host of other potential monks have joined [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] journey, and they carry a significant endowment for the support of the monastery.\n\nHow can we put them to use?"
 abbacy_events.2.a: "Give the noble a high position"
 abbacy_events.2.b: "Make them first throw away their money"
 abbacy_events.2.c: "Invest in our long-term stability"

 abbacy_events.3.d: "One of our members has lapsed into sin! It was discovered that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has been derelict in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] duties of prayer and labor, and may have even been cavorting with the local masses!\n\nWhat should be done about this outrageous breach of our monastic code?"
 abbacy_events.3.a: "Let the breach slide"
 abbacy_events.3.b: "Expel the weakling!"
 abbacy_events.3.c: "Penance and rehabilitation"
 abbacy_events.4.t: "Reforming Our Charter"
 abbacy_events.4.d: "A set of rules is the fundamental basis of life in an Abbey or Priory. Over time, however, these rules can become obsolete or neglected, prompting a series of reforms.\nIt is time that our monastery engaged in such a reformation - but we must choose which tradition to orient ourselves toward. Some favor the Cluniac model, while others find the Cistercian and Benedictine models more fitting to apostolic poverty."
 abbacy_events.4.a: "A Cluniac charter"
 abbacy_events.4.b: "A Cistercian charter"
 abbacy_events.4.c: "A Benedictine charter"
 abbacy_events.5.t: "Local Noble Seeks Blessing"
 abbacy_events.5.d: "In many cases, Abbacies were founded by a local noble who wanted to atone for their sins on the battlefield and in their daily life. Rich donations would allow for a community dedicated specifically to prayer for that individual's salvation - penitence by proxy. It was this practice that led to the foundation of Cluny by the Duke Guillaume of Aquitaine in AD 910.\nA powerful figure in the surrounding area has come to us requesting our help in that regard, and promises our role will not be forgotten."
 abbacy_events.5.a: "We shall pray"
 abbacy_events.6.t: "A New Abbey?"
 abbacy_events.6.d: "When one abbey gets too crowded for its own good, trusted monks will leave to found a new one, nominally subservient to the original. This is how Bernard's original abbey at Citeaux became a continent-spanning network of Cistercians - he had left his original home Molesme Abbey for its perceived vices.\nThough they do not complain of vices, some of our monks think it is time they established one such suffragan abbacy in the nearby woods."
 abbacy_events.6.a: "Go forth"
 abbacy_events.7.t: "Vows of Stability"
 abbacy_events.7.d: "Benedictine friars were required to take a vow of stability to ensure the Order's safety from decline. This anchored them to a specific foundation, but allowed them to wander the lands as a mendicant, preaching the good word and interacting with people from diverse backgrounds.\nMost recently, one of our mendicants has returned with a novel idea on how to increase our efficiency around the abbey."
 abbacy_events.7.a: "Wonderful"
 abbacy_events.8.t: "Finances Squandered"
 abbacy_events.8.d: "Those of a more Cluniac character contend that in our obsession with Apostolic poverty, our monastery is squandering its finances and potential. The monks already leave in cold, bare chambers, and if some improvements aren't made to the monastic grounds, these monks demand in inquisition from our parent house. One cannot help the poor or live a holy life if one is unable to move from sickness!"
 abbacy_events.8.a: "Give in"
 abbacy_events.8.b: "Worldly fools!"
 abbacy_events.9.t: "Purists Threaten to Leave"
 abbacy_events.9.d: "The ultimate ideal of Apostolic poverty is being ignored, argue some of our monks with Cistercian sympathies. They have issued an ultimatum - reform our abbacy, or they will leave en masse to found their own! Clearly they fancy themselves latter-day successors to Bernard of Clairvaux."
 abbacy_events.9.a: "Accommodate them"
 abbacy_events.9.b: "We don't need them!"
 abbacy_events.10.t: "Apostolic Duties Ignored"
 abbacy_events.10.d: "Those of a more Benedictine character in our abbacy think the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is lapsing into laziness. Meetings in the chapter house are not occurring on time, periods of silence are being ignored, and mistakes have even crept into the practice of Mass. What should be done about these Benedictine objections?"
 abbacy_events.10.a: "Pray for forgiveness"
 abbacy_events.10.b: "Who cares?"
 abbacy_events.11.t: "Reorganizing Our Theocracy"
 abbacy_events.11.d: "With the approval of Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has decided to reorganize our theocratic state along new lines that are more suitable for our current circumstances."

 almoravids_events.1.d: "Spurred on by strict orthodoxy and missionary zeal, the Almoravids have recently united the warring Berber tribes of Mauritania under [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. With the end of instability in the region and the pacification of the Sanhaja tribes, the Almoravids' gaze has quickly turned to the infidel Emirates of Morocco. Thanks to an alliance with the Atlas Berbers, a massive Almoravid army was now able to cross the Atlas Mountains. In no time at all, the Almoravids conquered the major cities of Southern Morocco, ousted their former rulers, and seized the land for themselves..."

Shall we assist our brothers in faith by money and men?"

 almoravids_events.5.t: "Almoravid Withdrawal"
 almoravids_events.5.d: "An envoy was sent to you by the Almoravids last night: [MOR.Monarch.GetTitle] [MOR.Monarch.GetName] of Morocco, citing issues in the Maghreb and the need to further consolidate [MOR.Monarch.GetHerHis] power base, as well as success in Iberia, has decided to withdraw the Almoravid force sent to your aid. A cursed day for the realm."
 almoravids_events.5.a: "Moroccan Scum!"
 almoravids_events.6.t: "Moroccan Prevention"
 almoravids_events.6.d: "Our diplomats report of a dwindling power of the Taifa kingdoms of Iberia, caused by lax military and spiritual activity of their rulers. On top of that, many Taifa rulers have lapsed into a decadent and wasteful lifestyle that they can only finance through unbearable taxes. In order to prevent them from being captured by the aspiring Christian kingdoms of the North, our advisors propose to conquer the Taifas beforehand."

The Almoravids of Morocco, after helping Al-Andalus defeat the Christians, returned to their African dwellings. But yet here they are, and this time to fight us, not the infidels!

 canton_events.1.d: "One of the Canton's richest merchants has died, leaving no legal heirs. We can repossess his lands and fortunes for the state, or allow them to be divided between the many dubious claimants that have come out of the woodwork.\nThe latter path, while counterintuitive, could help bolster the fortunes of our Canton's other merchants, ultimately increasing our trade and tax revenues."

 canton_events.4.t: "War College?"
 canton_events.4.d: "The Swiss experiment with republicanism is unique within Europe.

 celestial_empire_events.1.d: "With the fall of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] the last remnants of the Rus have been crushed. Their Unity and the ancient Slavic administration are now clearly seen as defunct concepts and the Rurikovich family will have to evolve into something else or perish.\nThough the memory of the Rus will live for some time the [Root.GovernmentName] of [Root.GetName] will forever be remembered as the destroyers of the last [From.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 celestial_empire_events.2.t: "An Ideology for our Principality"
 celestial_empire_events.2.d: "By assuming the mantle of the Kievan Rus we have taken a step into an old tradition. [Root.GetName] has inherited a number of institutions, such as the Cyrillic alphabet and the concept of fraternal cooperation, that are closely associated with the Slavic practice of Orthodox Christianity.\nAs the new Grand Principality it is up to us to which degree we wish to integrate this ideology with our own, but embracing the Eastern Rite would likely both help us rule the vast realm we now claim and strengthen our Fraternity in the mind of the public."
 celestial_empire_events.3.t: "Russification"
 celestial_empire_events.3.d: "The [Root.Culture.GetName] people have increasingly come to resent the new Russian customs we have been introducing throughout our realm, from the court to the lowliest provincial official. Due to this growing distrust of the alien impositions on our old traditions and norms some even openly question our right to rule."
 china_events.1.d: "It seems the local officials of the Veche in [trade_problems_province.GetName] has taken it upon themselves to stimulate local commerce. A series of regulations issued have, while quite contrary to official policy, managed to provoke a local trade boom, with many local families getting into lucrative business while also attracting foreign merchants from overseas. The Posadniks are, however, imploring us to shut them down and retract the local stipulations as they are an affront to good governance and central power."
 china_events.2.d: "As merchants from every corner of the world seek out the rich cities of the Kievan Rus it is no wonder that some will at times encounter groups they consider to be their enemies. Local officials are puzzled by a number of of disturbances in [port_incident_location.GetName] that seem related to two such competing groups trying to establish themselves in the same region.\nFearing that the unrest will spread our Bojars are suggesting that we close down the markets and remove any foreigners in the area. The local Veche, however, instead recommend that we fine both sides but allow them to continue purchasing our goods."
 china_events.3.d: "By employing a tactic of constantly tailing the Grand Prince and building trust with him at every opportunity, court factions have managed to outmaneuver several previously influential courtiers and are increasingly gaining influence over the day to day palatial rulings."
 china_events.4.d: "A powerful minister at the Princely Court has died due to old age. The death of this eminence has left a vacuum that the other factions are now seeking to fill. However, his passing goes beyond petty court politics. It is a profound loss for the Grand Principality and we are expected to provide the man with a stately funeral as a token of our appreciation."

 china_events.5.d: "Preparing for the seasonal flooding of the Dnieper is one of the oldest and most important duties of any state in the Kievan Rus. Our officials have identified an area that has suffered in particular during the last few years. It would blossom if we could only stop the water from threatening the livelihood of the locals." 
 china_events.6.d: "One of our most respected courtiers has presented us with an expensive gift in the form of an enormous and carefully constructed countryside manor. Though nothing compared to the Princely treasury, the gift is quite grand and it is clear to any observer that the doner must be expecting to get something in return..."
 china_events.7.t: "Destitute Coins"
 china_events.7.d: "As more and more unbacked coins are being issued by the Princely government our Posadniks are fearing that inflation will soon be a growing problem in the Kievan Rus and in the provinces the people have started talking about this being a sign of us losing mutual Fraternity.\nA representative arrived at court today proposing a scheme to reinvigorate the economy by means of a temporary tax combined with reforms to the treasury."
 china_events.8.d: "Money has been mysteriously disappearing from the Princely treasury for some time now, and you have started to direct your suspicions to a court official employed as a treasury book keeper."
 china_events.10.t: "The Marshal's Vice"
 china_events.10.d: "An influential proponent of the military at court has harbored a dark secret. For some time, the courtier in question has been under the influence of an ever worsening and consuming alcohol addiction. Despite flagrant rumors circulating this Marshal insists that the matter be kept under a lid. He promises that he will try to reform his ways, and to try to practice moderation in the future."
 china_events.13.d: "Officials have undertaken a project to expand the levy in [levy_province.GetName] by improving and updating the local censuses. The reform promises to bring additional manpower to the army, and improve the province's future troop recruitment. The Posadniks, however, would argue that leaving the locals alone would likely increase the value of the province more long term."
 china_events.14.d: "One of our Field Marshals has been caught red-handed siphoning off funds intended for our defenses. He is a disgrace to his family and for himself. This his ill conceived deed has severely hurt the defensive capabilities of the forts in [corrupt_fort.GetName] and [corrupt_fort2.GetName], causing the Kievan Rus to appear weak."
 china_events.16.d: "Word has reached you that a truly exceptional essay has been written in one of your provinces. It argues convincingly and in excellent literary style that it is folly to expect a country to be rich from increasing taxes. Our examiners describe this text as 'profoundly crafted' and there is no doubt that it will give rise to a new style for political essays for years to come.\nThe meat of the essay itself, however, cannot be ignored. The argument that avoiding high taxes makes the people as a whole richer and therefore the Grand Principality itself richer is a classical wisdom it is easy to overlook."
 china_events.16.b: "We must stay clear of such dangerous influence!"
 china_events.19.d: "A Volga River tax barge, containing a significant share of this year's taxes from the southern provinces, has been boarded and seized by criminals. The official responsible for maintaining security has reportedly suffered a nervous breakdown and is now locked up in his bedchamber, refusing to come out."
 china_events.20.t: "Silver Mine Discovered"
 china_events.20.d: "A silver mine has been discovered in one of our provinces by a young official. Exploiting this new and rich lode may seem like a foregone conclusion, but some warn against the venture, citing concerns over a potential overextension of the money supply."
 china_events.22.t: "Renovating a Cathedral"
 china_events.22.d: "An ancient cathedral in one of our provinces has fallen into disrepair after several years of neglected maintenance. A local official has now requested funds to restore the cathedral."
 china_events.25.d: "Several Posadniks have been very active in foreign diplomacy lately. [country_of_interest.GetName] in particular occupies the faction's attention. They believe opening up more channels for trade and cooperation would be beneficial for both of our countries. Some would rather argue that [country_of_interest.GetName] should submit to the authority of the Kievan Rus.\nThe foreign ambassador has been summoned to the [Root.GetAdjective] palace. What shall we tell him?"
 china_events.26.d: "Court officials are worried that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is being unduly influenced by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] consort. As member of a prominent family of the realm [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has an interest in the power that comes from being near [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Princely majesty.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], however, see no risk in this, it is merely natural that everyone seek the favor of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 china_events.27.t: "Grand Princely Insults"
 china_events.28.t: "Inspecting The Streltsy"
 china_events.28.d: "The armies have amassed on the exercise field for the Grand Army Inspection of $YEAR$. Everywhere you look there is a forest of spears and swords, aiming in defiance at the heavens above. Several powerful generals and marshals are present. Over the past few years these men have done everything in their power to strengthen the army.\nThe safety of the Kievan Rus depends on these troops, but it is not unheard of for a strong General to covet the Grand Princely throne himself..."
 china_events.31.d: "[From.From.GetName] has fallen and the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty is now believed to be the new holders of the Russian throne. We are expected to pick up the mantle of the Grand Prince and bring the Russian people into a new era of prosperity and stability.\nIf we want to win over the remaining supporters of [From.From.GetName] rule we must start to build our own Royal bureaucracy and invest in a strong and durable state. On the other hand [Root.Monarch.GetName] worries that disloyal officials will remain within any organization we inherit from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors."
 china_events.31.c: "The treasury needs to be filled first."
 china_events.32.t: "History of the [From.From.GetAdjective]"
 china_events.32.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], your reign has ushered in a new era and as the [Root.GetAdjective]s complete their take-over the Rus will undoubtedly prosper for many years to come. Perhaps the time has come to look back to the [From.GetAdjective] and start the compilation of their history. Compiling the fortunes of the Rus during their entire reign would cost a fair bit of money and take many bureaucrats quite some time, but the benefits might outweigh the costs."
 china_events.32.b: "A thorough work for a solid rule."
 china_events.34.d: "Melting glass particles onto metal surfaces to create ornate decorations and the art of enamelling is expected of every great artist. Mastering this art, however, is a rare sign of brilliance. In our chancellery [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] is known to be an expert enamelist, producing great works for the glory of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dynasty.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has lately taken a great interest in this art, studying the work of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] in detail, impressed by the beauty and elegant work. It has therefore come as a great shock when a lesser official confessed that the allegory of the lauded works of [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] have frequently been veiled criticism of Princely Power."
 china_events.35.d: "A strong army has always been required to secure the borders of the Kievan Rus. In times of weakness the savages in the regions outside of our reach have never hesitated to raid or even invade our lands.\nTo ensure our safety the commanderies are asking to send expeditions into the frontier regions, probing the strength of the Barbarians while also demonstrating our might."
 china_events.36.t: "Varangian Era Statuette"
 china_events.36.d: "A rare statuette from the Varangian era has been discovered during renovations of an old temple. The idea has crossed your mind that it might be clever to bestow the statuette upon a worthy subject to strengthen his loyalty to you, The Grand Prince. Loyalties will doubtlessly change on account of such an impressive gift delivered directly from the Grand Prince's own hand. Who shall we give it to?"
 china_events.37.d: "The records of a liturgical chant, which has been lost has been rediscovered during an inventory of an old library in one of our provinces. This marvelous discovery is seen by some as a sign of our benevolent rule."
 china_events.37.c: "The Kievan Rus is in good hands."
 china_events.39.d: "There is general consensus within the Princely Court that the amount of fiduciary media in circulation is much too great. Money must be recalled in order for inflation to recede from its current level, but the question is how much money should be rebought."
 china_events.40.d: "The teachings of Vladimir the Great stress the importance of understanding and respecting our traditional virtues that weave the web of society, and one of the most important relationships is that between father and son. Those who have gone before us deserve our thanksgiving, and it has been long enough since last we made an offering. Various courtiers have suggested sacrifices that your Majesty could perform. What seems most appropriate to present as an offering to honor the ancestors?"
 china_events.42.d: "One of your Marshals has been insulted by a high ranking official of the Posadniks. Apparently the men have had a hard time getting along for quite some time, and the insult was probably not entirely unprovoked. Nevertheless, the matter has become a pivot point of factional politics at the court, and it might be wise if the Grand Prince himself gave some input on the issue."
 china_events.42.b: "Relieve the Posadnik of his duties."
 china_events.42.c: "Denounce both for wasting the time of the Princely Court."
 china_events.43.t: "A capital for the Kievan Rus"
 china_events.43.d: "As befits a new ruler of the Kievan Rus it is now time to select the new seat of our dynasty. The location of our capital is likely to influence [Root.GetName] politics for years to come."
 china_events.43.a: "The Mother of Russian Cities!"
 china_events.43.b: "The City of Golden Domes in the North."
 china_events.43.c: "Along the Moskva in Moscow."
 china_events.43.e: "The Ancient City of Novgord."
 china_events.45.t: "Rise of Paganism"
 china_events.45.d: "Our weakening grip over the grand principality and the increasingly popular notion that we are losing mutual Fraternity has given rise to a variety of Rodnovery movements around the country. Remembering the last days of Pagan rule our officials are categorizing these sects as members of the Rodnovery society but in truth it seems there is a great disparity in their motivations.\nWhat they do have in common, however, is the goal of disruption chaos and the overthrowing of our established and perceived oppressive rule."
 china_events.45.a: "What can they do against the might of the Grand Principality?"
 china_events.46.d: "The Seasonal rains have hit us unusually hard this year. As the Dnieper River levees break and homes are washed away the sky itself seems to be weeping for our dynasty. In the provinces rumors have begun to circulate that this catastrophe is a sign of the loss of Fraternity and the iminent collapse of the [Root.Country.GetAdjective] Grand Principality."
 china_events.47.t: "Brigands on the Trade Roads"
 china_events.47.d: "With Fraternity seemingly not in our favor, things have quickly gone from bad to worse in several provinces across the country, where brigands and highwaymen are becoming ever more of a problem. The problem has been particularly noticeable along what remains of the old Varangian Roads."
 china_events.49.d: "You can only stare in awe as the glowing white of the sun disappears behind the black disc suspended in the sky, and the world turns to darkness despite it being mid day. A few minutes later the disc has passed by the sun, and light returns. You are shaken by the experience, but many of your subjects are absolutely terrified. Some whisper that the eclipse proves that Fraternity has passed from our dynasty. What should we make of this situation?"
 china_events.50.d: "Integrating Greek principles into our society is excellent for turning out well educated and thoroughly competent bureaucrats and officials, ready to face the various challenges of day to day rule and administration that the Kievan Rus possess.\nThat same education is, however, now making our administrators very weary of some of the measures we have been taking recently. Believing the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to be acting without mutual Fraternity has made many officials unwilling to comply with our demand. At times it would seem Grand Princely authority doesn't stretch further than one can see from the palace walls."
 china_events.51.d: "It is becoming more and more apparent that the power of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] is waning and that the Grand Princely center is unable to rule the Kievan Rus, much less maintain any kind of authority over the outer states.\nWith the refusal of the [unruly_subject.GetAdjective] to submit before what they believe to be an illegitimate Grand Prince it seems our influence beyond our borders has deteriorated sharply."
 china_events.52.d: "Plagues, famines, droughts and calamities are becoming increasingly frequent in $COUNTRY$ these days, and now a particularly nasty disease has arrived at court. Yesterday morning a Voivode employed at the Public Works Office was found dead after having complained of a sore throat the day before. The disease is now spreading throughout the court, and several more are already showing symptoms. Fraternity is no longer with us, it would appear."
 china_events.53.d: "A scream echoes through the palace, but soon dissolves again into the silence and black of the night. A courtier has been murdered, found in his bedchamber with a blade buried deep in his back, and several stab wounds to the rest of his body. Fratricide and internal strife are becoming ever more common in $COUNTRY$, and many believe that we no longer enjoy mutual Fraternity."
 china_events.54.d: "For the past nine months you have been an expecting father, and today one of your concubines did indeed give birth to a son. The joy is cut short, however, when the child is brought before you. His face is deformed into what looks like a permanent scream, and soft, black fur-like hair grows in patches over his little body. The child is misshapen, and your physician suspects that the deformity has affected his mental capacities as well. Some claim that this disaster proves that we no longer enjoy mutual Fraternity."
 china_events.55.t: "The Riches of Ruthenia"
 china_events.55.d.not_emperor: "The [empire_of_china.GetAdjective] [empire_of_china.Monarch.GetTitle] [empire_of_china.Monarch.GetName], the former Grand Prince of the Rus, is weak and has little support in the territories he still controls. From north to south, the ordinary Russians are questioning his rule and the normally so loyal voivodes are openly proclaiming that [empire_of_china.Monarch.GetName] has lost the mutual Fraternity.\nRogue [chinese_border_province.Culture.GetName] officials claiming to represent [chinese_border_province.GetName] have approached [Root.Monarch.GetName], imploring us to free them from the oppression of [empire_of_china.GetName] and end the rule of the [empire_of_china.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty."

 china_events.55.d: "The Grand Prince of the Rus is weak and has little support. From north to south, the ordinary Russians are questioning his rule and the normally so loyal voivodes are debating whether [empire_of_china.Monarch.GetName] has in fact lost mutual Fraternity.\nRogue [chinese_border_province.Culture.GetName] officials claiming to represent [chinese_border_province.GetName] have approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] imploring us to free them from the oppression of [empire_of_china.GetName] and end the rule of the [empire_of_china.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty."
 china_events.56.da: "The Posadniks have recently delivered their reports on the past years' advancements within their respective areas of expertise, and there is dire news. One of them has significantly lowered their estimates of the rate of future progress. These news come at a time when it is becoming increasingly more evident that we no longer enjoy mutual Fraternity."
 china_events.57.t: "Global Unrest"
 china_events.57.d: "Local princes all over the Grand Principality are watching with great interest as our control over the provinces grow ever weaker. In some regions they have already begun to usurp our authority and in others outright rebellion seems to be imminent."
 china_events.57.a: "The Fraternal System is Crumbling..."
 china_events.58.t: "Posadnik Howls at the Moon"
 china_events.58.d: "Queer noises have been coming from the villa of one of the Posadniks during the night lately, increasing in intensity and strength with each passing month. Initially you put it down to some intricate playtime with one of his concubines, but recently it has begun to dawn on you that there is a remarkable connection between the lunar phase and the noises. A spy sent into the garden on a full moon night returns with disturbing news: The Posadnik spends his nights standing in his garden, howling at the moon."
 china_events.59.d: "Terrible news reach us from the Dnieper River, where a number tax barges, carrying a substantial amount of the taxes for $YEAR$, has sunk during a particularly nasty bout of bad weather. The Posadniks of the Treasury interprets these events as a sign that our dynasty no longer enjoys mutual Fraternity, and argues that we must accept and respect this turn of providence. How shall we respond to these ill tidings?"
 china_events.60.d: "Provinces have reported to the capital that they are now in full compliance with several sets of new princely edicts, the only problem is that you've never issued any such edicts. An investigation into the matter reveals that forged bronze plaques with written edicts, bearing your seal, have somehow found their way to the province governors. It is a dark time when people dare challenge the Grand Prince openly, and many claim that this is because our dynasty no longer enjoys mutual Fraternity. What shall we do about these false edicts?"
 china_events.61.d: "The Waning influence of the Grand Princely Palace in the border areas have resulted in local officials proclaiming that we no longer possess mutual Fraternity. They have turned to the neighboring [From.GovernmentName] of [From.GetName], inviting them to invade our lands."
 china_events.62.t: "Waning Fraternal Power"
 china_events.62.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] Fraternal is rapidly declining, as is their ability to project any kind of power beyond their borders. Our representatives in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] report that their attempts to get an audience with the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] has been met with nothing but feeble and insulting excuses."
#El Cid
 cid_events.1.t: "El Cid"
 cid_events.1.d: "Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar has been a rising figure in the Castilian court as of late. Already, he has shown his martial prowess in military campaigns across Iberia, most notably against the taifa of Zaragoza. The Moors have already taken to calling him 'al-Sayyid', or the Lord, for his abilities as a commander. Furthermore, his ability to inspire those under his command seems to be unparalleled. This raises the question as to whether we should take him into our service as a leader of the Castilian forces, as doing so would greatly enhance our chance of success in the coming Reconquista against the Moors."
 cid_events.1.a: "We must enlist this great leader!"
 cid_events.1.b: "I'm afraid you'll have to journey elsewhere"

 cid_events.2.d: "Today, a man going by the mysterious name of 'El Cid' has arrived at your court. He claims to have journeyed all the way from [From.Capital.GetName] to [Root.Capital.GetName] in search of employment, after being rejected by [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName]. We have heard tales of this man's accomplishments on the battlefield as a renowned commander, and so his offer to lead our army seems promising indeed. Should we accept El Cid into our ranks?"
 cid_events.2.a: "If Castile didn't want you, we'll have you"
 cid_events.2.b: "I'm afraid you'll have to go on your way"
 cid_events.3.t: "El Cid"
 cid_events.3.d: "El Cid, a man notorious for his military campaigns against our Taifa, has now wound up at our court, ill and exhausted from days of travelling. He claims that both [From.From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.From.GetName] and [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] have both refused his offer to serve them as a commander, resulting in his exile and journey to [Root.Capital.GetName]. Though he was once our enemy, we could put our past animosity behind us and make him leader of our armed forces. He may prove useful to us in the fight to reclaim the lands we once held from the Christian conquerors."
 cid_events.3.a: "Welcome, El Cid!"
 cid_events.3.b: "I'm afraid there's no room for you here"
 cid_events.4.t: "El Cid"
 cid_events.4.d: "We have been approached by a talented commander calling himself 'El Cid'. Having been sent on his way by all others who he sought to serve, it seems we now have no choice but to take him in to command our armies, where he would make an excellent addition."
 cid_events.4.a: "This is an opportunity we can't refuse"
 cid_events.5.t: "El Cid's Ambition"
 cid_events.5.d: "Thus far, El Cid has proved to be an invaluable asset to our military. His revolutionary methods and tactics have sent many an enemy fleeing in fear, and inspired just as many to fight under our banner. But he is a precious asset, as his loyalty has shifted between both sides of the raging conflict on the Iberian peninsula in the past. Therefore, it has not come as a surprise that El Cid now appears to have harbored a new ambition: to carve out an independent kingdom for himself to rule on the chessboard of states in Iberia.\nHis sights are set on the prosperous city of [2024.Capital.GetName] and its peripheries, where he tells us he will swiftly claim victory with a sizeable army. However, he currently lacks the funds needed for such an expedition. Despite the risks, we could gain a valuable ally if El Cid's campaign is successful. On the other hand, if we refuse, El Cid could just as easily use his influence to seize the reins of power here..."

 cid_events.6.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], there is an urgent situation unfolding in [2024.Capital.GetName]! An acclaimed general known as El Cid has marched a sizeable army across our borders and into the city, seizing it and its riches for himself! He has declared his plans to establish his own kingdom with [2024.Capital.GetName] as its seat, something which we cannot tolerate. We must take back what is rightfully ours, or give in to their demands in the hope that we may take advantage of them later."

 cid_events.7.d: "Despite our best efforts, El Cid was able to hold on to the city of [2024.Capital.GetName], thereby allowing him enough time to fortify the city. Though we have lost this war, we will bide our time and strike again, when the time is right..."

 cid_events.8.d: "We have inflicted a humiliating defeat on the general once considered untouchable, beating his forces at every turn. Upon reentering [2024.Capital.GetName], however, we found the city to be completely and hurriedly looted. Meanwhile, the whereabouts of El Cid himself are undetermined, but it is likely he fled into the wilderness with the remnants of his army. After this shattering blow, El Cid will cease to play a role in Iberian politics."

 confucian_events.1.d: "Our efforts to integrate our [pagan_province.Religion.GetName] subjects have now finally started to pay off. Our pagan subjects have begun to accept the ideals of Bogomilism and our local officials have also integrated elements of the local religion and culture in our wider Bogomilist corpus of ideals. As local bureaucrats enter our administration the pagan customs have to some extent began to filter upwards.\nPaganism has become one of the many influences within our Bogomilist [Root.GovernmentName]."
 confucian_events.1.a: "We welcome them"
 confucian_events.2.t: "Assimilation of Heretics"
 confucian_events.2.d: "Over time our some of our heretical subjects have grown accustomed to our ways and taken to our rites and our superior administrative ideals. Where there was once distrust in the theology and our system of anticlericalism there is now widespread understanding. In turn these subjects have been taken in and made part of our [Root.GovernmentName], and some of their customs have now become ours. In [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] even some of the best educated Bogomilist scholars can be seen partaking in these customs and visiting the formerly heretical churches."
 confucian_events.2.a: "We welcome them"
 confucian_events.3.t: "Assimilation of Islam"
 confucian_events.3.d: "Islam has been a minority religion for centuries in our lands and was so not a new religion to us when we first became the overlord of the people of [islamic_province.GetName]. Over time, however, it has grown into a more and more integrated part of our society. Muslim ideals have been integrated and harmonized with our traditions, rites and methods and we have taken the best of what the religion has had to offer to mold to our own uses. Islamic scholars, doctors, merchants, farmers and peasants can be found even in the districts around [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. As long as they bend the knee to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] the followers of Allah are an integral part of our society."
 confucian_events.3.a: "We welcome them"
 confucian_events.5.t: "Assimilation of Judaism"
 confucian_events.5.d: "It has been centuries since the first Jews arrived in our country but it is not until recently that we have had this great numbers of them in our society. In a newfound fascination for the original Abrahamic religion we have done what we can to integrate them in our rites, traditions and education. As we have strived to harmonize Bogomilist texts with the teachings of the Torah Jewish philosophers, traders, soldiers and artisans have become evermore present parts of our society. Eventually as traditions fuse these people have become a cornerstone of our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 confucian_events.5.a: "We welcome them"
 confucian_events.6.t: "Assimilation of Gnostics"
 confucian_events.6.d: "The bearers of a tradition that is said to be even older than our own the Gnostics are a people that have seen their political influence come and then fade. It was clear that we had much to learn from these teachings, as they could learn much from our superior tradition of reason, justice and fairness. When communities such as the one in [zoroastrian_province.GetName] became part of our [Root.GovernmentName] it allowed our traditions to begin a new phase of harmonization, fusing the ancient teachings of their prophets with those of Bogomil. We are still a country where the classics are learned and lived by but Gnostics are now an integral part of our society and to some extent their wisdom has become ours."
 confucian_events.6.a: "We welcome them"
 confucian_events.10.t: "Assimilation of Buddhism"
 confucian_events.10.d: "Those of our subjects that are ardent followers of the great and mysterious Lamas have increasingly come to realize how useful an ideology the teachings of Bogomil are. Where they once used the traditions of the Tantrayana way to judge the world they are now incorporating the same classics that we have. Tantrayana monks and nobles are now part of our government both at the very top and at the very bottom and their somewhat wild and Tantric traditions appears to have been tamed by our reason and learning."
 confucian_events.10.a: "We welcome them"
 confucian_events.11.t: "Concept of God"
 confucian_events.11.d: "The followers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith have increasingly come to integrate Bogomilist concepts and our rites in their daily life. A recent trend is to identify the concept of God with their own supreme saints. This interpretation is somewhat unorthodox to the scholar experts of our [Root.GovernmentName], but it has allowed the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faithful to integrate a number of Bogomilist concepts, rites, constants and classical teaching in their theology.\nThere is some debate in the palace halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] if this is the right and proper way on the path for the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] adherents to elevate themselves from infidels to true believers."
 confucian_events.12.d: "The [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s are a people with strong traditions and rites and their adherence to the archaic language of their own teachings is holding them back from progressing towards civilization. If they are to ever elevate themselves from the Infidel Paganism of this world we must perhaps ensure that the traditions and the proper rites are available for them to digest in their own language.\nThere are some scholars that have already begun to create such works. Should we encourage them to continue synthesizing their old religious concepts with the sublime principles of Jesus Christ?"
 confucian_events.13.d: "Our trusted minister and confidant, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has worked closely with our [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] community in order to help them elevate their infidel culture. Surprised at [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] findings, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has started to adopt many [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] concepts after studying their science and literature intensely. Many worry that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has gotten too taken in by [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ways. Some even claim that our [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] has secretly converted, shaming [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] ancestors and the [Root.GovernmentName] alike."
 confucian_events.14.d: "While they are part of our [Root.GovernmentName] some [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] traditions can be very hard to stomach. A civilized people is supposed to abide by what is right and logical according the Bogomilist teachings, but these men and women have many customs in direct contradiction of such rules. Our officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have been struggling with the locals who insist on their infidel ways."
 confucian_events.15.d: "While the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] are infidels, they have some customs and rites that we might make use of. As their traditions and ceremonies regarding rulership already contains a concept of a high worldly power such as our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] this is something we could make good use of. Local officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have already been doing so but it has been suggested that we make use of [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ceremonies even at higher levels. Others argue that we would be shaming our ancestors and turning our back on what is proper if we allowed these traditions to contaminate ours."
 confucian_events.16.d: "Over time the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s have come to take to many of our customs. When our [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetTitle] visited the area of [harmonization_province.GetName] [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHe] found that they are still far from civilized, however, and when a local influential landholder invited [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHim] to participate in a naming ceremony for a child named for its father that was the last drop.\n[Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] returned from the area with a very low opinion of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s and of their prospects to ever count themselves among the civilized people of the world."
 confucian_events.17.d: "Some infidels are more susceptible to reason and intellect than others. The [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s of [harmonization_province.GetName] have already taken to many of our traditions, from the more important to even minor things. Visiting foreigners have a hard time telling the region apart from [Root.GetName] proper as apart from some minor eccentricities the [Root.Capital.Culture.GetName] language, names and customs seem as [Root.GetAdjective] as any part of the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.GovernmentName]."
 confucian_events.18.t: "Feckless Heir?"
 confucian_events.18.d: "The rule of our great [Root.GovernmentName] is the foremost responsibility and privilege of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] have in the past prided themselves on leading through example, observing strict etiquette, personal austerity and carefully weeding out those that do not conform to this ideal.\nIt is therefore with a heavy heart that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has observed the development of [Root.Heir.GetName]. Far from an ideal [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan] our royal heir is often described by [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] teachers as a petty person, focused on immediate gain and emotional pleasures. There are, however, factions at court that would be most dismayed if we abandoned [Root.Heir.GetName], a new heir would not have their support."
 confucian_events.18.a: "Such a [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan] is not fit for our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 confucian_events.19.d: "A vernacular novel about a well-known story from ancient times is rapidly gaining popularity among our subjects. This in itself is not a problem but it has come to our attention that this novelization is in fact breaking central tenets of Bogomilist ideology as it could be seen as an argument for disobeying central authority and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nOur administrators now argue that the book must be banned, though some fear this will only make it more alluring to those that wish to read it."
 confucian_events.20.d: "Education, self-improvement and adherence to the traditions are the backbone of our government and if our [Root.GovernmentName] is to aspire to greatness we must at all times devote money, attention and energy to ensuring that our officials are as well educated and well informed as they can possibly be. It is therefore of some concern that the number of people seeking government employment seem to be decreasing as of late."

 eastern_monarchy_events.1.t: "Uncooperative Doukes"
 eastern_monarchy_events.1.d: "Byzantine rulers had to rely more on the cooperation of ad-hoc landowners ruling from manor houses than on something resembling an organized feudal system. It was almost as if the lands of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] were tributaries under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], though without any officially held titles. If the doux of a certain area was uncooperative, those tax revenues were simply lost, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would often have to militarily remind the doux of their obligations."

 eastern_monarchy_events.2.d: "Along the Empire's frontiers, local customs often abounded, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s grasp was quite weak. Thankfully, our ecclesiastic hierarchy has been exemplary in certain areas, promoting the legitimacy of the government and the divine right of [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName].

 eastern_monarchy_events.3.d: "Since the Byzantine Empire was quite decentralized, famines could be particularly devastating to individual regions. In the old Roman Empire, the government attempted to assuage this issue by fixing bread prices and subsidizing bread rations to affected populations.\nIn the last harvest a famine has stricken one of our provinces, causing widespread unrest among the peasantry, and the local doux is unable to handle things. Should we attempt to use that ancient Roman solution?"

 eastern_monarchy_events.4.d: "In the Byzantine Empire, hereditary rule was sometimes weak and the whole concept of a 'dynasty' was muddied by adoptive members. Rather than sons succeeding fathers, powerful generals would force the ruling [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to recognize them as an heir or just overthrow the government entirely at the head of their army.\nOur court spies have reported rumors that one of our top commanders is planning to do just that, citing the weakness of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Clearly we must not allow this to happen - it was the scheming general Phokas in 602 that slew the great Emperor Maurice and ruined the primacy of Christendom in the face of its heathen rivals!"

One particular doux has approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] requesting special rights and allowances, so that he may strengthen his family's hold in that particular region.\n\nTo grant his request would certainly anger the other powerful families in our state, but would ensure the loyalty of that area for the time being."

Although the strict reforms of [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors were highly controversial and met with much opposition, in the end they were an urgently needed step towards reforming the Byzantine administration.

Our great reliance on foreign, even uncivilized, people in our armies and administration is putting the Unity of our dynasty in question.\nUnless we take measures to become a truly Russian Principality we will remain Grand in name only and will appear to have lost our Unity."

 empire_of_china_in_name.2.d: "Our efforts to integrate the Russians in the state that rules them have born fruit and our claim to Unity is no longer in question due to lacking ties to the people themselves.

 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9100: "Lollards were a heretical group following the theological teaching of disgraced Oxford professor John Wycliffe, who contended that Bibles should be translated into the vernacular. Popular protests against the wealth, power, and pride of the clergy were frequent, and in times of disorder would express themselves in an extreme form. Church inquisitors have already tried to persecute these Lollards several times in the past, but friends in high places have protected them so far. Now, it seems they are getting out of control."
 flavor_eng.EVTDESC9104: "The Hundred Years War was the last great medieval war. It was a war not just between kings, but lesser nobles were also able to pursue their own personal agendas while participating in the larger conflict. Future wars saw far less factionalism, at least on the scale found in medieval conflicts. The Hundred Years War was actually dozens of little wars and hundreds of battles and sieges that went on for over a century, between 1337 and 1453, until both sides were exhausted. While neither side won in any real sense, the end result was that while there were two kingdoms at the beginning of the war, there were two nations at the end of it."

He claims he's part of a voyage from the Kingdom of Jerusalem, a voyage that, to our knowledge, has never been attempted before. He brings greetings from fellow Christian monarchs, though his prayer is unlike that which we have seen before. How should we treat this man?"

[From.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has sent an ambassador to our court. He is a Christian, albeit of a kind we have never seen before, and begs us to restore his master's rightful dominions, but Seljuk power is still threatening and it seems to be a big risk for questionable gain. Should we aid them?"

As the Islamic world reels from this loss, Moorish refugees flock to the Muslim cities and courts of North Africa and the Middle East, bringing with them knowledge, works by exceptional scholars like Abu al-Walid ibn Rushd, Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi and Abu Bakr ibn Tufail. Inviting these refugees to $COUNTRY$ might provide an enormous boost to our own efforts in the fields of science and culture."
 flavor_hol.202.d: "Come one, come all! [2729.GetName] used to be the heart of the Western trade. A city embellished with the beauty of a thousand arches, blessed with the coin from the four corners of the Earth, which sadly had fallen into disrepair! \nThankfully, our recent conquests in the region and the redevelopment of the city have led to it experiencing a substantial amount of its former glory and importance, all thanks to splendid [Root.GetAdjective] administration!"

It was here where Saladin seized power from the Fatimids and founded our glorious dynasty, so the region's importance for our dynasty cannot be overlooked. As we now control Egypt's most important cities, some are suggesting that we should consider moving our capital to Egypt in order to further solidify our rule over the region.

Even though [5475.GetName] is well fortified, the surrounding terrain provides no advantage to the defenders if the city were ever besieged by the Turks. Many are suggesting that it would be wiser to move the court to a different city, one further away from the border with the Ottomans.

 flavor_hun.53.d: "Our new investments in the development of [5475.GetName] have paid off, as the city continues to gain wealth and size, we now have the ability to look towards the future. Even now many question if we should use our newfound production capabilities to focus on producing different kinds of trade goods in our capital. Perhaps we should look to producing goods that will stand a better chance of generating profit in the future. Many have been suggesting to focus on the processing of raw material imported from the mines of Upper Hungary and Transylvania, while others wish to establish new manufactories for the production of cloth or glass, that would rival even the famed Bohemian and Venetian works. What shall we do?"
 flavor_jap.60.t: "Silver found in Éile Uí Fhógarta"
 flavor_jap.60.d: "Last year a merchant reported finding silver in the mountains of the Éile Uí Fhógarta province. The supply of silver seems almost bottomless and the mine that was built has since then become the major source of income for the entire province, and indeed promises to become a major source of income for all of [Root.GetName]."
 flavor_jap.EVTDESC10: "It would seem the political climate in $COUNTRY$ is not as stable as was thought. Traveling across the country, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was resting at a church near his forces when the army's general saw an opportunity and surrounded the church with his forces, claiming that 'the enemy was inside'. Only the swift and decisive action of loyalist troops led to the timely rescue of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the traitor's capture.\n\nThe general's motives are unclear, and he could well have been motivated by anything from a desire for revenge to a blatant lust for power. The incident has reaffirmed [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s control over the troops, however, the brief skirmish that erupted has cost the lives of many good men, and it is clear a renewed focus will be required on internal politics to ensure that this does not occur again."
 flavor_jap.EVTDESC31: "The prevailing peace of past few years has left many in the Gallowglass caste without work. These idle hands have now found an employment in exploiting and oppressing the local peasant population. They will need to be dealt with."

This might be a good time to show the other clans that we intend to retain our position for ourselves and for our family, but on the other hand a more lenient approach in our dealings with them might cast us in a more favorable diplomatic light."
 flavor_jap.EVTDESC45: "A beautiful Celtic torc in our study has caught the eyes of an royal retainer, and word of this fantastic artifact has spread to the royal court, and the High King himself. There seems to have developed a quiet understanding between ourselves and the High King that this torc be presented as a gift to the High King from his most loyal subject."
 flavor_jap.EVTDESC46: "The first Cider of the season is ready, and the traditional tasting is only a few weeks away. The question is whether we should invite the High King for a celebratory first tasting, or if we should try to leverage our position in the marketplace and sell early instead."
 flavor_jap.EVTDESC48: "Due to the prevalence and social status of Gallowglass, the people have become fascinated with their martial arts and way of life. The ideals of the Gallowglass have come to wield more and more influence in $COUNTRY$, and even in the mind of the wider world our country and 'Gallowglass' have become synonymous.\n\nAs the influx of modern weaponry and the relative internal peace after the clan wars have reduced the military role of the Gallowglass, these elite warriors increasingly find themselves in positions in the courts of their masters as bureaucrats or administrators. They are no doubt skilled, but some circles have expressed their sadness that the pride of our military should be relegated to such ordinary work."
 flavor_jap.EVTDESC49: "Our spies have uncovered a nasty piece of information that another clan would probably not want to see spread around the world. We could use this opportunity to weaken his position, however, getting a reputation for spreading rumors would likely harm our prestige."
 flavor_jap.EVTDESC50: "A young man has arrived at our capital today, claiming to be a long-lost son who was kidnapped by a rival clan years ago. Through sheer audacity and luck he managed to escape their clutches and has now returned home to once more take up his rightful place as the [Root.GetAdjective] heir. Furthermore, as a result of his long years spent in captivity he can surely tell us many of their secrets."
 flavor_jap.EVTDESC52: "Of late, reports have come in of powerful criminal factions rising in our home domain. The resulting rise of widespread criminality, extortion, and looting has led people to increasingly question our leadership. If this is not dealt with now, it might well spiral totally out of control."
 flavor_jap.EVTDESC53: "A new generation of Gallowglass has come of age. The relative peace with which we have been blessed during the past few years has caused the young generation to grow up soft, and more disposed to administrative tasks than to the Art of War. We could accept this development, or call for a return to more military virtues."
 flavor_jap.EVTDESC54: "Our military traditions are strong, and we could use this as leverage by funneling it into strengthening our position within Ireland."
 flavor_jap.EVTDESC55: "A criminal recently arrested in our native domain has acquired a fair amount of popularity among local peasants for resisting supposedly corrupt tax collectors.

Divided into two parts, the sermon first emphasizes the superiority of the Grace found in the New Testament over the Law of the Old Testament. Hilarion draws parallels between Isaac and the followers of Christianity, and Ishmael and the Jews, highlighting the chronological progression from the Law to Grace.

 germanic_monarchy_events.4.d: "Different Germanic leaders interacted with their noble councils in different ways. In some cases Kings ruled like near absolute monarchs, actively working against the interests of the nobility, and in other cases Kings ruled as virtual puppets of the [Root.GetGermanicAssembly]'s whims and consulted with it on every important affair. At the very least, it was expected that a legitimate monarch would convene a meeting of the [Root.GetGermanicAssembly] once per year if not more.\nRecently some members of the [Root.GetGermanicAssembly] have proposed that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] rely more on conciliar rule to manage the state, arguing that it will ease the burden of leadership.

Our realm today is still nominally comprised of many folklands which serve as mid-level administrative divisions, but it has been a long time since they have been properly surveyed and organized.\n\nIf we commission a grand reform we may be able to draw them more closely to our centralized state structure."

This news somehow made it to the Pope himself, who has urgently requested that we send a team of bishops to the area to see if the rumors hold any water and to condemn these travelling heresiarchs if they are found.\nHopefully they will return with word that the whole story is more nonsense from the gossip-monger peasants and we can get this whole matter behind us, like that business in Gévaudan with the supposed man-eating wolf."

 hohenref_events.1.d: "Heresy is nothing new. In the patristic days of the Catholic church, there were earth-shattering controversies as idiosyncratic theologians formulated and spread controversial ways of exegesis. Since our divorce from the Byzantine rite, however, there has been a newfound attention to perceived abuses within the church. An inquisitory force dispatched to Occitania from the French Crown has discovered that such sentiments have finally reached a boiling point as a new faction labelling itself 'Cathar' - 'Pure' - has taken hold in $PROVINCENAME$. These Cathars are neo-Gnostics and believe that they can achieve 'perfection' by living in ascetic self-denial.\nThe Holy Father would be most displeased if we do not take action against their practices."
 hohenref_events.1.a: "Arrest them immediately!"
 hohenref_events.2.t: "The Waldensian Heresy"
 hohenref_events.2.d: "A wealthy merchant named Waldes in $PROVINCENAME$ has taken up the Cathar mantle by giving away all his possessions and embracing a life of 'perfection'. The only trouble is, he has organized many other townspeople to join him in a sort of rabble-rousing mission. Chanting their motto 'Lux Lucet In Tenebris', they are spreading the radical and dangerous idea that salvation will come most easily to those who live in Apostolic Poverty. They levy attacks directly against the Church, claiming its richness is an affront to scripture, and prattle on about camels traveling through needle-eyes.\nWith two different heresies now discovered in Southern France, the Holy Father will surely be apoplectic!"

 hohenref_events.3.t: "A Bosnian Church?"
 hohenref_events.3.d: "Seizing on rife unrest regarding the religious establishment, a faction within Bosnia has proposed a separation from both the Catholic and Orthodox churches, decrying the very notion of a state-influencing church as contrary to scriptural wisdom. Though most view them as another incarnation of the Bogomilist heresy, they deny the accusation, and insist that the truest path for Bosnia is to embrace our own church where no far-away powers can impose their will on us, and practitioners will restrict themselves to private matters of conscience."

 hohenref_events.4.t: "The Fraticelli Heresy"
 hohenref_events.4.d: "Saint Francis is, of course, an eminently respected Catholic hero. However, discontent within the order has led a certain monk named Angelo Clareno to promote a new, extremist branch of 'Spiritual Franciscans' who advocate complete poverty and regard the established Church's wealth as damning. They claim any ecclesiastic figure who holds personal wealth forfeits his holy status, and encourage the poor masses into their hermetic lifestyle. Though some have attempted to reach a concordance with the Papacy, Clareno insists on open disobedience. This wouldn't be such a problem, if it wasn't spilling out right into our lands.\nThe Holy Father will be quite wroth if we let this heresy blossom on his doorstep."

 hohenref_events.5.t: "The Hussite Heresy"
 hohenref_events.5.d: "It's happening again. Feelings of anger at the [Root.Religion.GetName] establishment have manifested in a [Root.GetAdjective] preacher named Jan Hus, who attacks the Holy Church itself from his pulpit and spreads controversial ideas on the Eucharist and other ecclesiastical matters. His central thesis is that the universal church is morally bankrupt and must be reformed wholesale, and he has accrued quite a large and violent following. Every action church officials take to restrict his doctrines only causes more unrest.\nWe must wipe these Hussites out before they snowball into a paramilitary army!"

 hohenref_events.6.t: "Anabaptists take $PROVINCENAME$"
 hohenref_events.6.d: "When Martin Luther spread Protestantism across Europe, he brought with him a cavalcade of minor heresies and competing sects, each with views more bizarre than the last. One of such sects is the Anabaptists, who contend that baptism should be reserved for informed adults; those who were baptized as children should be re-baptized; and tout extremely radical ideas about property.\nWe would normally not concern ourselves with this rabble, but a heresiarch preacher in our capital has riled up these Anabaptists into a full-scale insurrection, taking over the administrative palaces and barricading the city walls. We must send in the army!"
 hohenref_events.6.a: "Wipe them out"
 hohenref_events.7.t: "Tempting Ideas"
 hohenref_events.7.d: "The Protestant Reformation has brought with it a host of strange and novel ideas about the Christian faith. One of the more esoteric views has come to be known as 'Anabaptism', referring to those who believe people should only be baptized as adults when they can make an informed, rational decision.\nWhen [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was travelling through [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] Square recently, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] came across a mendicant preacher promoting the Anabaptist way of life. Before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] guards could beat the man down, [Root.Monarch.GetName] stopped them and continued to listen to his public sermon. It seems the preacher was quite tempting, as East Frisia is now considering a conversion to this strange new sect."

In $YEAR$, tutors and learned lecturers in theology, philosophy, classics, science, and other subjects can be heard imparting their knowledge to new generations of young nobles, allowing for a dissemination of academic expertise around the continent.

Frequently, these privileges also affect politics, trading of goods, or social life. It is not uncommon for students and townspeople to clash and engage in violent or even armed conflicts. Regardless of the outcome, such disputes are usually decided in favor of the academies, as they are usually not subject to the city's jurisdiction.\nA notably brutal confrontation has now occurred in [institution_province.GetName] when a squabble between some students and an innkeeper has escalated.

Guilds were associations of merchants and craftsmen, centered around the structure of the City, often with the support of Royal decree. Growing out of post-conquest English law, guilds spread throughout Europe like wildfire in the twelfth and thirteenth century, with an explosion in $YEAR$. The structure of the guild could be replicated on even larger scales, with entire cities banding together into similar leagues of cooperation.

Spiritual centers in Italy, France and Germany backed these reforms, further developing and spreading them.\nAs support for these reforms continues to grow everywhere, we should likewise consider promoting and implementing these papal reforms in [Root.GetName] ourselves, trying to end centuries of political and social upheaval, doctrinal ignorance and the petty venality among the clergy."

 inti_events.6.d: "A ruler is expected to travel around his kingdom, inspecting each and every part of his realm and partaking in the religious as well as worldly ceremonies of his chiefs. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] approaches the huge temple of a local god, the royal priests urge caution. This is an unusually popular god and if we are seen to honor the gods of our subjects too clearly we would be giving them too much power and authority.\nOn the other hand this god is said to be very powerful and its popularity along with the favors it might provide are very enticing."
 inti_events.6.a: "Honor the God."
 inti_events.6.c: "Force the chief to destroy the Temple."
 inti_events.8.t: "Temple of Memphis"
 inti_events.8.d: "As the father of the gods, from whom all life emanates, Ptah is revered as one of the most powerful creator gods. As the creator of the cosmos, he first created himself and then formed mankind from clay and a potter's wheel.\nIn Ancient Egypt, a magnificent temple complex adorned the royal residence of Memphis, of which only ruins remain today. To praise Prah, we should restore the splendor of the former temple."
 inti_events.9.t: "Priestly Confessors"
 inti_events.9.d: "After a recent war guilt lies like a heavy blanket over our people. It is time to give them the opportunity to purify themselves from the sins they have had to commit in times of war. Our priests have signaled that this would be an opportune time to hold a festival of purification and fasting so that anyone could confess to the priesthood and be cleansed in the streams of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.10.d: "Word has reached us that a local chief in [Root.GetName] has begun to construct an ambitious new temple for a local god of his tribe. While the chief seems content to acknowledge our authority it is hard to shake the notion that he is attempting to build a bigger power base for himself in [Root.GetName].\nThe priests of Ra in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] strongly advocate that we forbid the construction to put this chief in his place."
 inti_events.10.a: "Order the chief to cancel the construction."
 inti_events.12.d: "Without oases and streams life in the deserts would be much harder and the spirits that animate the running water are certainly worthy of our appreciation. The time has come for a festival to honour the Nile. The fertile oases of Egypt are ready to receive our gifts."
 inti_events.12.a: "A sacrifice of tasty Beer to drink."
 inti_events.12.b: "A sacrifice of Oxen to ease their burdens."
 inti_events.12.c: "A sacrifice of fine Cloth to protect them from the heat."
 inti_events.13.d: "The people of the province of [Root.GetName] are divided and worship various local Gods. It has therefore been decided that a great temple of Ra should be constructed here as a natural centre for the spiritual and administrative life of the region.\nThe leader of the construction has presented [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] with two different plans for the temple. The first plan is to construct the temple at a Holy Site while the other plan calls for making use of an old shrine as the base of the new temple."
 inti_events.13.a: "A new temple needs a new location, the Holy Site it is."
 inti_events.14.d: "The world can sometimes be an unforgiving place and fate may turn in surprising ways. Luckily we have the Gods of our people to help us interpret what the future holds. Should the future be too hard for the Gods to penetrate there are other oracles in our realm, but they require a worthy gift before sharing their visions. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been beset by ample doubts recently and it is perhaps time to consult the auguries."
 inti_events.14.a: "Consult the local oracle at [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.14.b: "Travel to the great Oracle of Behdet."
 inti_events.14.c: "We must go to the Oracle of Thebes."
 inti_events.15.t: "Favorable answer from the Oracle"
 inti_events.15.d: "A great number of diviners are attached to any given Oracle's shrine. After [Root.Monarch.GetName] asked the Oracle for its knowledge the priests are interpreting the behavior of sacred animals. Other priests are drawing lots and consulting statues through which a priest apparently speaks creating a prophetic mood.\nAll of these great diviners have now dwelt on the questions [Root.Monarch.GetName] has come to pose and all agree that the time ahead will be a most fruitful and successful one."
 inti_events.16.t: "Conflicted answer of the Oracle"
 inti_events.16.d: "A great number of diviners are attached to any given Oracle's shrine. After [Root.Monarch.GetName] asked the Oracle for its knowledge the priests are interpreting the behavior of sacred animals. Other priests are drawing lots and consulting statues through which a priest apparently speaks creating a prophetic mood.\nAll of these great diviners have now dwelt on the questions [Root.Monarch.GetName] has come to pose but the answer is not as favorable as he would have hoped. The signs are conflicted and as far as can be discerned the future holds both risks and opportunities for us."
 inti_events.17.t: "Outcasts Wanting to Go Home"
 inti_events.17.d: "With the conquest of new lands we have come across groups of people that have been forcibly moved as outcasts from one region to another by their former overlords. As outcasts are not allowed to change the way they speak, the clothes they wear and have to take all their property with them, these people have never stopped to yearn for their original homes.\nAs it happens their area of origin is also under our control and a delegation from the outcasts has therefore been sent before [Root.Monarch.GetName] claiming that their Gods have told them to return, begging us to lift their obligations."
 inti_events.17.a: "Allow the outcasts to return."
 inti_events.18.d: "The priests of a local god in [Root.GetName] have been trying to inflame opinions against our rule by saying that we are slowly attempting to increase the authority of Ra and marginalize that of all the syncretic Gods. Luckily most of our subjects know better than to listen to these wild accusations but one of [Root.GetName]'s tribes supports the priests and have now demanded that we give them guarantees for the safety of their Gods and their people."
 inti_events.18.a: "The time has come for these people to move on."
 inti_events.18.c: "These priests are only fit for the stake."
 inti_events.20.t: "Heb-Sed, the Festival of the Tail"
 inti_events.20.d: "The supreme priests, in charge of piety in the entire country, have proclaimed that the most opportune time to celebrate the Heb-Seb festival is almost upon us. The festival which lasts several days typically involves the entire population of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as well as important chiefs from the countryside to renew the rule of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 inti_events.20.c: "All chiefs and all priests must attend the ceremony."
 inti_events.21.d: "Some of the chiefs that have been called have taken offense to being ordered around and have refused to join the Heb-Sed festival."
 inti_events.22.t: "Priests Kept"
 inti_events.22.d: "Priests in charge of local Gods have taken offense to come to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and are refusing to come."
 inti_events.23.t: "Invitation to the festival of Heb-Sed"
 inti_events.23.d: "A messenger has arrived from [From.GetName] demanding our presence at the festival of Heb-Sed in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.23.a: "Then we must go to celebrate the [From.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 inti_events.23.b: "Let's stay home and honor our own [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 inti_events.24.d: "[From.Monarch.GetName], the ruler of [From.GetName] has declined our invitation to join in the celebration of Heb-Sed."
 inti_events.25.t: "Celebration of Heb-Sed"
 inti_events.25.d: "After several days of fasting and abstinence the time has come for the festival of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. As the population of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] prepare for the grand ceremonies in which [Root.Monarch.GetName] is greeted and animals sacrificed they also know that several days of feasting are ahead of them."
 inti_events.26.t: "Celebration of Heb-Sed"
 inti_events.26.d: "After several days of fasting and abstinence the time has come for the festival of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Squares of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] are filled to their brim as the ceremonies to greet [Root.Monarch.GetName] begin and animals and other gifts are sacrificed by the people of our [Root.GovernmentName] and the many chiefs under our rule. Several days of feasting and gifts given by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to his subjects now await."
 inti_events.27.t: "Celebration of Heb-Sed"
 inti_events.27.d: "After several days of fasting and abstinence the time has come for the festival of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Squares of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] are filled to their brim as the ceremonies to greet [Root.Monarch.GetName] begin and animals and other gifts are sacrificed by the people of our [Root.GovernmentName] and the many chiefs under our rule. Several days of feasting and gifts given by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to his subjects now await."
 inti_events.29.t: "Feast of the Valley"
 inti_events.29.d: "There is great distress in our lands. People are suffering and many fear for the future. In times like these an Wadi celebration for the entire kingdom might lighten the minds of our subjects. The sacrifices it entails will also make the Gods more listen to our plights.\nFor this festival our priests are urging that we undertake a human sacrifice as the plight of our people have been great and they feel a grand ceremony is necessary to placate the gods."
 inti_events.29.a.tt: "Hold a customary festival with sacrifices of Cloth, Bread, Oxen and Sheep."
 inti_events.29.b.tt: "Hold a larger and longer festival culminating in the sacrifice of Humans."
 inti_events.30.t: "Wadi Celebration"
 inti_events.30.d: "After days of celebration the future certainly looks brighter. Grand ceremonial dancing ceremonies in the public squares of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], feasts for all vassal chiefs and ample sacrifices of animals, vegetables and cloth to the gods will ensure that the Gods look more favorably on our realm in the future."
 inti_events.31.t: "Wadi Celebration"
 inti_events.31.d: "After days of celebrations, public feasting, ceremonial dancing and both initiated and ended with the sacrifice of the most perfect humans our lands could bring forth, we feel confident we will face a brighter future."
 inti_events.32.t: "The Medjay"
 inti_events.32.d: "The honor to guard the life of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is prestigious and belongs to a number of men in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]. This honor is in itself not a guarantee of martial prowess however. After a tour in the provinces it is clear to [Root.Monarch.GetName] that the quality of the guard could be dramatically improved if we brought in some new blood from the countryside.\nThis would, however, not be well received by the men currently given the privilege, at least not until the new members have been integrated for the next time."
 inti_events.33.t: "Alarmed Warrior Caste"
 inti_events.33.d: "A delegation from some of the best warriors in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] demanding that the new members of the Medjay be sent back to their homes in the provinces. While they are pleased that the institution as such was not changed they are abhorred by the kind of people that now have the prestigious right to guard the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. These men are not fit to be part of the bold warrior caste of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.34.d: "During the customary serving of beverages to the commoners from around the royal litter in the squares of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] today [Root.Monarch.GetName] was attacked by a small group of would-be assassins. The group suddenly retreated without being anywhere near achieving the goal of hurting [Root.Monarch.GetName], but it was worryingly clear that the Medjay never saw this coming. Perhaps because they are not yet used to the bustling environment of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.36.d: "The investigation into the attack in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has uncovered an amateurish plot by a group of young men that felt marginalized in the Medjay. They claim that the attack was never intended to harm anyone, just point towards the weaknesses of the new additions to the guard. The punishment for treason is clearly death but the families of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] would clearly not feel any less threatened if we killed their sons. If we forgive them the transgression perhaps that will be the end of this."
 inti_events.36.a: "To the lion cages!"
 inti_events.36.b: "Forgive the men."
 invasion_events.1.t: "Province Falls!"
 invasion_events.1.d: "The occupation of $PROVINCENAME$ by the hostile invaders $CONTROLLERNAME$ has taken quite a toll on the local population. All resistance has collapsed, and the province is effectively lost to their power."
 invasion_events.1.a: "We will reconquer it later"
 invasion_events.1.b: "Tell them to hold out"
 invasion_events.2.t: "Arrival of the Ilkhanate"
 invasion_events.2.d: "Following the ruthless execution of Mongol envoys and merchants by decree of Ala ad-Din Muhammad II of Khwarazm, Persia was wholly subjugated by the Mongol hordes within two years. With unmatched speed, the infamously brutal horsemen looted, razed, and downright leveled many Persian centers to the ground, leaving Persia a desolate wasteland in the aftermath.\nAfter subsequently destroying the seeds of rebellion planted throughout Persia and consolidating their rule, the Mongols have shifted their gaze further west, with their next target being Mesopotamia. A potential Mongol invasion, warn chroniclers and the superstitious alike, may reshape the political landscape of Mesopotamia for centuries to come."
 invasion_events.2.a: "It's the End of Days!"
 invasion_events.3.t: "Arrival of the Golden Horde"
 invasion_events.3.d: "Under the watchful command of Temüjin - more commonly known as the warmonger Genghis Khan - a divided Mongolia was united into a string of allied tribes. Notorious for having rapidly conquered swathes of territories in China and Central Asia in unison, they have already subdued the Tatars with relative ease. Greedy for more blood and treasure as always, the Mongols have began to venture further west, bringing any opposition down to grovel at the feet of their deadly horsemen.\nRumors of the merciless steppe warriors slaughtering entire cities in mere days has ignited flames of despair within the hearts of the populace; even the largest and most powerful armies of the empires of Europe stand no chance against the superior armies of the Mongols."
 invasion_events.4.t: "Safavids Arrive"
 invasion_events.4.d: "As internal disputes over the throne weakened the Timurid Empire in the 15th century, it became increasingly unable to take effective action. Seizing this opportunity, the armies of Qara Qoyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu launched attacks, successfully occupying significant portions of Persia. Amidst this tumultuous period, the militant Sufi order of Safawiyya emerged as a dominant force. Originating from Ardabil, they first conquered Azerbaijan and eventually extended their rule over all of Persia.\nThe leader of the Safawiyya order has recently assumed the title of Shahanshah of Persia and declared Shiite Islam as the official state religion of his Empire. It is evident that this zealous leader aspires not only to rule Persia but to extend his dominion far beyond its borders."
 invasion_events.4.a: "These are dark times"
 invasion_events.5.t: "Seljuks Arrive"
 invasion_events.5.d: "One of the Turkmen clans of the Oghuz tribe in Central Asia has led a powerful army into Persia and rapidly overthrown the local powers. These Turks are descended from a certain Seljuk who recently converted to Sunni Islam, and call themselves 'Ghazi' - warriors of the faith who will liberate the world from heathens and Shi'a heretics.\nThe Shiite Buyid branches in the east stood no chance against the might of these Seljuk Turks, and now they have turned their eyes toward Mesopotamia. They vow to ultimately fulfil the Prophet's last commandment on his deathbed - to destroy the Roman Empire and to occupy the holy city of Constantinople."
 invasion_events.6.t: "Timurids Arrive"
 invasion_events.6.d: "When Khan Abu Baghatur died without heir in 1335, the Ilkhanate shattered completely in the confusion of unclear succession, giving rise to small Persian, Turkic and Mongol rulers and governors. Shortly later, a dreaded general named 'Timur' ascended to the Sultan of Transoxania, leading his forceful with cunning and a hard hand against his impotent foes.\nWith the recent smashing of the small dynasties in Persia, Timur usurped the lost legacy of the Ilkhanate. However, the hunger for power of this cruel Sultan does not seem to be satisfied as messengers report the overwhelming invasion of Mesoptamia by Timur 'the Lame', willing to create a new order once again."
#Irish Clan

 irish_clan_events.1.d: "Unlike feudal Europe, Ireland organizes its succession around the concept of Tanistry rather than primogeniture. An adult male relative who seems fit for the throne is nominated to succeed the current ruler - this can be his son, but such a relationship is not a necessity. Since our Clan is without an heir, it is now time to honor this ancient tradition and search through our relatives to find someone fit for our glorious throne."

A young man who has served as a simple soldier in a clan army up to now impresses with his martial skills among his ranks. Our traditions imply that only men of noble blood have the right to lead our armies, but this time we could break them and appoint this common man a general."

 italian_monarchy_events.3.d: "The politics of Italian Communes were just as much locked between monarchists (Signoria) and republicans (Communia) as between Guelphs and Ghibellines. Despite the Ghibelline alignment with the Empire, there was little rhyme or reason to which faction matched which political philosophy. Most city-states were stuck in an endless cycle of republican revolutions and strongmen founding brief dynastic states.\n\nA festival this month has given us the opportunity to raise public support for our political agenda.

 italian_monarchy_events.5.d: "It has come to the attention of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that one of our best generals is involved with a plot to overthrow the ruling family and install himself as leader. Such machinations were common in Italian city-states amongst the class of higher nobles and official 'protectors', and would often spell a long-term change in dynastic fortunes. Since we have discovered this plot, we can exile the general from our city, but we will obviously lose his talents if we do so."

 italian_monarchy_events.6.d: "One of the preeminent artists of our Commune has created a beautiful set of frescos and paintings for a local church. So beautiful, in fact, that it would embellish our administrative palace with its presence. The ruling family is quite enamored with the artist's work, but appropriating it from the church would certainly ruffle feathers around the Commune.\nIt was precisely this action for which Cicero famously prosecuted Gaius Verres in 70 BC.

#Nahuatl Uatsdin events
 nahuatl_events.1.d: "After intense study of the skies and the relevant calendars our priests agree that everything indicates that harsh and troubling times are ahead. As commoners and nobles alike prepare for what is to come many will attempt to save themselves from the bad times by sacrificing some of their food and cattle."
 nahuatl_events.1.a: "Organize a royal sacrificial ceremony."
 nahuatl_events.2.a.tt: "The child will be educated as a commoner"
 nahuatl_events.2.a: "He should undergo an education appropriate to his status."
 nahuatl_events.2.b.tt: "The child will be educated as a noble, furthering his potential but people will take note of the break with tradition."
 nahuatl_events.2.b: "Treat him like the son of a nobleman."
 nahuatl_events.3.t: "Aspiring Warrior"
 nahuatl_events.3.b: "Let us sacrifice some of our cattle to aid him."
 nahuatl_events.4.t: "Victorious Warrior"
 nahuatl_events.5.t: "Captured Warrior"
 nahuatl_events.5.d: "Despite the very favorable omens it seems the young warrior born all those years ago has been captured by the enemy. If he does not die in the dungeon, he will soon face his destiny at the scaffold or be sold to slavery. While this is an honorable end the disappointment of his house is great."
 nahuatl_events.6.t: "Defeated Warrior"
 nahuatl_events.6.d: "Despite the favorable omens the young warrior born all those years ago has been slain in the field of battle. He will never become a great warrior now, nor will he bring [Root.GetName] glory and honor ever."
 nahuatl_events.7.t: "Incompetent Warrior"
 nahuatl_events.7.d: "Despite the very favorable omens the young boy born all those years ago has proved to be a disappointment to himself and his house. In the face of battle he has proven a coward, staying back and failing to make a single capture despite having multiple opportunities to do so. Upon his return to [Root.GetName] he will forever be known as a failed warrior."
 nahuatl_events.10.t: "Incident during Uastyrdzhi Festival"
 nahuatl_events.10.d: "A noble of one of our most prominent families was found drunk in the street today. Not only is this a terrible affront to the gods, punishable by flogging, but it happened during the time of Uastyrdzhi Festival when all disturbances of the peace are strictly forbidden."
 nahuatl_events.10.a: "Punish him."
 nahuatl_events.11.d: "We have received word from one of our provinces that a man claiming to have magical powers is spreading fear and evil rumors there. The Elders are confident that this is a mere charlatan that they can handle but many commoners are susceptible to his influence."
 nahuatl_events.11.b: "Let the Elders deal with him."
 nahuatl_events.13.d: "The sorcerer spreading fear in our lands has been caught. The traditional punishment for a man like him would be to cast out evil spirits from him, robbing him of his magical powers. As this man has managed to cause much more harm than the average countryside conjurer, however, perhaps it would be better to punish him by death immediately to placate gods and men alike."
 nahuatl_events.13.a: "Summon the exorcist!"
 nahuatl_events.14.t: "Evil Spirits"
 nahuatl_events.14.d: "News has reached us that the punishment of the sorcerer who caused so much unrest in our lands did not go exactly as planned. None of this involved remain to tell the tale but the rumor that has been spreading is that the man was an evil spirit and that an owl was seen leaving his cell. Regardless of if he did turn into an owl or not, the whole incident has caused wild rumors to spread all around our country."
 nahuatl_events.15.d: "It seems the sorcerer that got away from us once has now returned. The Elders insist the man has been spreading diseases and making ill-boding predictions and must be stopped."
 nahuatl_events.15.b: "Let the Elders deal with him."
 nahuatl_events.16.t: "Wrathful Gods"
 nahuatl_events.16.d: "A great disaster has befallen us. This morning $HEIR$ was missing. One of the child's servants insists that the perpetrator was a spirit bearing resemblance to a woman that died giving birth nearby recently. That such a dark creature would be able to spirit away our heir in the middle of the night is surely a sign that we have infuriated the gods."
 nahuatl_events.16.a: "We must do what we can to placate Barastyr."
 nahuatl_events.17.d: "$MONARCH$ has taken ill and has a rising fever. The doctors in attendance have recommended a number of infusions from roots and herbs."
 nahuatl_events.26.t: "Merchant Spies"
 nahuatl_events.26.d: "The rich merchant trade guilds are essential to the trade network of the Caucasian and their members are generally free to cross our borders as they please. This unreserved welcoming has, however, evidently been exploited by our rivals as a number of traders now stand accused of espionage on their behalf."
 nahuatl_events.27.t: "Traders Harassed"
 nahuatl_events.27.d: "The trade guilds based in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have come to us asking that we punish [From.GetName] for harassing their members. Apparently the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] claims that the merchants have been spying on our behalf and has used this as an excuse to confiscate their goods."
 nahuatl_events.28.d: "The spoken word has always had a special significance to our people, songs and recitations feature prominently in all our religious and profane ceremonies and even our highest leaders are referred to as venerable idols. Oral poetry is therefore one of the most sacred forms of art and one of few accepted ways in which a person can express dissatisfaction, anxiety and even doubt about fate itself without angering the gods.\nRecently an immensely popular Ætsægdin poet has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], praising our city and its people but criticizing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]."
 nahuatl_events.29.d: "The main temple of our capital is the primary symbol of our rule and the bond we have with the gods. It is where all of the main sacrifices will be made during the many festivals of the year and it is the main target for any invading enemy. For a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it is a duty to maintain and expand the temple whenever possible."
 nahuatl_events.29.a: "Undertake an ambitious expansion of the temple."
 nahuatl_events.29.b: "Time to renovate the temple."
 nahuatl_events.31.d: "Each and every citizen of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] awoke at once this morning as a powerful earthquake shook the entire city, destroying several buildings and even some of the temples. To the great relief of commoner and noble alike, however, the city and most of its inhabitants remain unharmed.\nWe must thank the gods that have helped us keep this world alive for sparing us today."
 nahuatl_events.31.a: "Praise Uatsilla, lord of rain, harvest and thunder."
 nahuatl_events.31.b: "Praise Huyændon Ældar, lord of fish."
 nahuatl_events.31.c: "Praise Fælværa, lord of sheep."
 nahuatl_events.31.dd: "Praise Tutyr, lord of wolves."
#Native American
 native_americans.24.d: "Since the settlers arrived from abroad, there has been much speculation among them about the origin of the ancient burial mounds in the region. The settlers refuse to believe our ancestors could have built such structures, being unimpressed with our current construction projects. While they are clearly fascinated by the mounds, they seem to dismiss both us and our neighbors as unable to create anything of lasting value."
 native_americans.25.t: "The Banquet"
 native_americans.25.d: "An important visitor has honored us with his presence. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to decide whether to celebrate a Banquet in our guest's honor or not. On the one hand, celebrating it will be a good opportunity to brag about our wealth in front of our people and theirs, on the other it is a costly thing that could cause us a lot of harm for future needs."
 native_americans.25.a: "No matter what, a banquet should always be held!"
 native_americans.25.b: "We will not hold a banquet now."
 native_americans.26.d: "When we were visiting [From.Monarch.GetName] and [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] people, a banquet was held in our honor. In this ceremony great gifts were given to us as a way to both honor our visit and prove how wealthy [From.Monarch.GetName] is. How should we respond?"
 native_americans.26.a: "The banquet was excellent, we feel honoured."
 native_americans.26.b: "The banquet was fine, thanks."
 native_americans.26.c: "The banquet was not that bad."
 native_americans.26.e: "The banquet was quite poor. We are disappointed."
 native_americans.27.d: "When we were visiting [From.Monarch.GetName] and [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] people, a banquet should have been held in our honor. In this ceremony great gifts should have been given to us as a way to both honor our visit and prove how wealthy [From.Monarch.GetName] is. How should we respond?"
 native_americans.28.b: "Catfish will be the prey."
 native_americans.28.c: "Nothing like some beaver hunting."
 native_americans.28.e: "Mountain goats are always a challenge."
 native_americans.28.f: "Only wisents are a proper prey."
 native_americans.29.d2: "A woman from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]'s tribe approaches [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] while [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is fishing as [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tribe usually does to feed their people. [Root.Monarch.GetName] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head towards her, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes meet and [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows she has seen something unusual, but good, nevertheless. With piety in her gaze, she whispers how she has seen the biggest catfish ever, a true incarnation of the spirit of the river we so deeply worship. [Root.Monarch.GetName] follows her to the spot where she saw it and after a few breaths [Root.Monarch.GetName] finally sees it. It is huge indeed. [Root.Monarch.GetName] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] tools to capture it."
 native_americans.29.d3: "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] was going back home with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] canoe after a good day of beaver hunting, [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw not far away from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] position a beaver seal, a true blessing from the gods, emerge from the depths of the sea. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spear and quietly moves closer to it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] leaves the row over [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] canoe, stand up and have the spear ready to be fired. The beaver emerges, their gazes contact as [Root.Monarch.GetName] releases the weapon."
 native_americans.29.d4: "The hunting group is coming back home when among the group of mountain goats that comes across [Root.Monarch.GetName], the biggest goat [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has ever seen appears. Almost as if it was a deity, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can feel a special bright aura around it and immediately knows [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] have to hunt it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] leaves the group behind and move silently to sneak the animal. When [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is ready, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] weapon, hoping to not miss the chance."
 native_americans.29.d5: "The land trembles as [Root.Monarch.GetName] gets closer to the herd of wisents. These animals can kill anyone with their gore attacks with ease, but they are also life for our people. Suddenly, among them, [Root.Monarch.GetName] can see a massive male that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] knows has to be [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] prey. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] prepares [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] for this unequal fight before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ancestors with a quick pray. The opportunity emerges right in front of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] tries."
 native_americans.34.t: "The Flight of the Hawk"
 native_americans.34.d: "A hawk flies over the camp. Nobody pays much attention until our priest starts to be nervous. People surround him. Even you are dragged near him. His words are bad. The flight of the hawk is too irregular and our priest thinks that is a bad omen."
 native_americans.34.b: "It is just a hawk."
 native_americans.35.t: "Wisents Are Breeding"
 native_americans.35.d: "The last few months have been rainy with the best possible outcome. Grass has grown greener and stronger than ever, food is so abundant that wisents have bred in incredible numbers. Spirits have really blessed us."
 native_americans.36.d: "The last hunt was very good and we managed to gather a lot of animal hides. While painted hides are common in other tribes, they usually do not have access to rich hunting grounds like us, making these big hides something that can be traded for a good price. Our traders have just come back. They bring riches with them."
 native_americans.37.t: "Peace across the Homeland"
 native_americans.37.d: "Some tribe leaders have accepted our invitation to gather together and bring peace back to the Homeland. While many people do not think this would work, others think it is well worth the effort."
 native_americans.38.t: "Broad Beans Are Scarce"
 native_americans.38.d: "Broad beans are the base of our diet. We use them for several of our dishes and this year, for some reason, the broad beans are scarce."
#Norman Invasions

 nrm_invasions.1.d: "A crisis unfolding in [irish_invasion_tag.GetName] about who will succeed its ruler [irish_invasion_tag.Monarch.GetName] has prompted reactions from a number of opportunistic nearby states seeking to gain politically themselves. However, recently we have been approached by [irish_invasion_tag.Monarch.GetName] [irish_invasion_tag.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] to resolve the conflicts gripping [irish_invasion_tag.Monarch.GetHerHis] nation once and for all by defeating the potential claimants to their [irish_invasion_tag.GovernmentName].\n\nSensing an opportunity to revitalize their fortunes by campaigning in an island long considered by us to be a bastion of barbarism, Anglo-Norman mercenaries have flocked to our banners led by the talented Richard de Clare, nicknamed 'Strongbow'. We can send them over to [irish_invasion_tag.GetName] to uphold the legitimacy of the current ruler, but it is unclear as to whether this will be worth the effort in the long run."
 nrm_invasions.1.a: "They want support, so they shall have it."

His declaration to be [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName] has been met with a mixed response both from within and afar, but he has claimed divine justification for doing so: a papal bull issued by the Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] known as Laudabiliter, supposedly authorizing him to take control of Ireland in the name of the [ENG.Monarch.GetTitle] of [ENG.GetName].\nFaced with such irrefutable evidence of his legitimacy, it seems we have no choice but to embrace this situation, especially now that the other claimants have been forced out."

This has not gone unnoticed by us yet we evidently have never thought ourselves vulnerable to this new threat - until now.\nA Norman mercenary known as [Root.norman_invasion_heir.GetName] has abruptly led his troops across our borders and sent a message to our court, demanding that we submit and install him as our new ruler, or face the destruction of our territory!\nThe decision is now ours: do we stand and fight to preserve our independence, or humbly submit to avoid further reprisals?"

 nrm_invasions.4.a: "Our [Root.GovernmentName] is no more!"
 nrm_invasions.5.t: "Annexation of The Pale"
 nrm_invasions.5.d: "Our monarchs have always coveted a foothold on Ireland in order to launch further invasions, in the hope of uniting the island under [ENG.GetAdjectiveCap] rule. Yet the Norman lords we sent to consolidate control over Ireland have been allowed to act with much greater independence than at home, to the point where they are de facto separate from the rest of the [Root.GovernmentName].\nTo remedy this, one of our advisors has suggested acquiring the valuable city of Dublin from [pale_owner_country.GetName] to use as a base for exerting further control over the de jure Lordship of Ireland. The proposal seems tempting and our loyal lords in the region will no doubt be pleased to see the order restored and power consolidated."

 nrm_invasions.6.t: "The Statutes of Kilkenny"
 nrm_invasions.6.d: "For some time now the reality of the Norman 'invasion' of Ireland has sunk in, and the results are less than satisfactory. While we expected the Irish to fully embrace our own culture and customs, we did not expect the Norman conquerors to be even more Irish still, having forsaken the English ways almost completely. Some have even gone so far as to actively seek alliances and marriages with the remaining Irish clans for their own protection.\nAuthored principally by the Duke of Clarence, the Statutes of Kilkenny are sweeping in their efforts at curbing the Irish influence on the English settlers. They forbid intermarriage between English and Irish and the use of Irish language, customs, names or dress. Most importantly, however, they replace the old Irish Brehon law with English common law to govern the English in Ireland, and separate the Irish and English churches."

These forbid intermarriage between English and Irish and the use of Irish language, customs, names or dress. Most importantly, however, they replace the old Irish Brehon law with English common law to govern the English in Ireland, and separate the Irish and English churches.\nRegardless of whether these new laws are best for our people and our ruling class, who have become indistinguishable from the Irish themselves, we must accept them for the time being."

 nrm_invasions.9.t: "Anarchy in [From.GetName]"

#Roman Factions
 pap_faction_events.1.t: "The Power Behind the Throne"
 pap_faction_events.1.d: "Throughout the middle ages, the Papacy traded hands between the influence of corrupt Roman families like the Orsini and Colonna. The Colonna usually installed their own scions as Cardinals, leading to the Papal Conclave sometimes being occupied by men only in their twenties. The Orsini were more amenable to controlling Popes via blackmail and powerful Orsini mistresses who could bend the Papacy to the family's whims.\nThe recent 'election' of Pope [Root.Monarch.GetName] was of course engineered by these shadow-rulers and marks their real control of the Holy See."
 pap_faction_events.1.a: "We shall obey the Orsini"
 pap_faction_events.1.b: "We shall obey the Colonna"
 pap_faction_events.10.t: "Pax Romana"
 pap_faction_events.10.d: "For over two centuries the See of Saint Peter has been under the thumb of thuggish and reprobate Roman aristocrats. At last, this era of rivalry is coming to an end as more enlightened ideas take root in the Lateran Palace and maverick Cardinals work to definitively rid the Holy See of corruption. The various branches of the Orsini have been forced to stand down, while the home base of the Colonna in Palestrina has been reduced to ruin. At the head of these grand reforms is a Papal Bull called Pax Romana, which unilaterally reconciles the two families and ensures the Conclave of Cardinals will remain unbeholden to any outside powers."
 pap_faction_events.10.a: "Finally we control our own fate"
 pap_faction_events.2.t: "The Roman Mob"
 pap_faction_events.2.d: "The Roman Mob has been an institution within the Papal State since the time of the Byzantine Duchy of Rome. The fickle masses are quick to agitate, and quick to turn against a Pope or Consul who they see as a threat to their interests. The current Pope, having been elected through the interference of corrupt Roman elites, is seen as illegitimate and now that the Mob has sidelined the Orsini and Colonna they have marched on the Lateran Palace to drag His Holiness through the streets!"
 pap_faction_events.2.a: "As the mob wishes"
 pap_faction_events.2.b: "Send in the militia"
 pap_faction_events.3.t: "Civic Defense"
 pap_faction_events.3.d: "The Roman Mob is outraged by the occupation of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and is preparing a general insurrection throughout the city. Key gates will be opened at night to let our troops regain control, and stealthy citizens with makeshift weapons are preparing to murder the guards that would otherwise keep the foreign garrison alerted.\nThe Mob is merely waiting for the word from His Holiness to put their plan into action and free [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] from the barbarians who have been harassing the populace and degrading the honor of the Holy See."
 pap_faction_events.3.a: "Go ahead!"
 pap_faction_events.3.b: "Tell them to be patient"
 pap_faction_events.4.t: "Clash With [papal_antagonist.GetName]"
 pap_faction_events.4.d: "It is well known that foreign powers meddle in Papal affairs and work to install local Popes loyal to their interests. The Roman nobility in turn often cooperate with these foreign rulers to exert joint control over the Holy Father, but sometimes these cooperative agreements break down and clashes break out. One such controversy has just emerged after a recent visit by representatives from [papal_antagonist.GetName], as the strings of [Root.Monarch.GetName] are being pulled in opposite directions. Things could get ugly if we do not make a decision regarding how to navigate this quagmire."
 pap_faction_events.4.a: "Curtail the Roman Nobility"
 pap_faction_events.4.b: "Side with the Roman Nobility"
 pap_faction_events.5.t: "Scandal Brewing"
 pap_faction_events.5.d: "The repeated abuses of Pope [Root.Monarch.GetName], a worldly puppet of the Roman elites, are becoming hard to ignore. Between the simony, the political double-dealing, the impious liaisons frequently known to occur... the Roman Mob has grown incensed by this corruption of the Vicarate of Christ and of the true Catholic faith. They are now demanding that we appoint a Cardinal to examine the state of the Holy See and root out corruption with a sweeping mandate, independent of the malign influence exerted by the Colonna and Orsini."
 pap_faction_events.5.a: "Hold an inquiry"
 pap_faction_events.5.b: "Cover it up!"
 pap_faction_events.6.t: "Unthinkable Simony"
 pap_faction_events.6.d: "The conniving Orsini, annoyed by the presence of a Colonna loyalist on the Chair of Saint Peter, have taken to undermining his power by exposing some of his gravest wrongdoings publicly before the Roman Mob! The hypocrisy of their whistleblowing when they themselves conduct all manner of corrupt and scandalous plots behind closed doors is outrageous. It has been revealed that Pope [Root.Monarch.GetName] was making overtures for a form of Simony hereto thought unthinkable - the sale of the Papacy itself. It is said that he was going to resign his Papal title and bestow it to the highest bidder in the city of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]! Not since the Crisis of the Third Century has [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] known such a vile and corrupt betrayal of the principles of rule.\nWith the plot exposed, the Roman Mob has seized the unfortunate bidder and held a mock coronation with tar, confiscating all of the money he was going to pay for the public weal."
 pap_faction_events.6.a: "Disaster!"
 pap_faction_events.7.t: "A Papal Mistress"
 pap_faction_events.7.d: "The Orsini have frequently swayed the occupants of the Holy See by supplying them with mistresses from their family. However, now that the Colonna have taken power in the Papal State, they have publicly humiliated the last Orsini Pope by exposing his violations of the highest principle of clerical celibacy. [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s reputation may never recover from this disaster, and the Roman Mob have already spread jeers and satirical songs throughout [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. The Holy Father's mistress was chased out of the Lateran Palace and forced into exile at one of the Orsini's fortified family estates in Umbria.\nHow dare the Colonna presume to expose this iniquity when they themselves are guilty of crimes far worse!"
 pap_faction_events.7.a: "Nothing can be done"
 pap_faction_events.8.t: "A Friend of the Colonna"
 pap_faction_events.8.d: "As unscrupulous and corrupt as they are, the Colonna are certainly effective at expanding the influence of the Papal State and navigating the world of diplomacy. The wedding of a Colonna heiress with an important magnate from [colonna_friend.GetName] has brought us a great opportunity to foster friendly relations between our states and ensure the [colonna_friend.Monarch.GetTitle]s of [colonna_friend.GetName] remain friends of the Holy See.\nThe current Patricius of the Colonna has approached Pope [Root.Monarch.GetName] asking for him to personally officiate the wedding at their villa in Tusculum this month. It would be unwise to refuse his request."
 pap_faction_events.8.a: "Bless the wedding"
 pap_faction_events.8.b: "We do not need their talents!"
 pap_faction_events.9.t: "Orsini Cardinals"
 pap_faction_events.9.d: "The Orsini have proven themselves to be deft administrators since the time of Pope Celestine III. By filling our administration with Orsini partisans, we can surely streamline the affairs of the Holy See and keep the local powerbrokers across [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] in our good graces. Of course if we do so, we run the risk of alienating the Colonna, who are always looking for a chance to get a leg-up against their eternal rivals."

The kings of León demanded tribute from Toledo, Badajoz, Seville, Granada, and Valencia, while the Counts of Barcelona demanded tribute from Zaragoza, Lérida, and Tortosa. Paria is now demanded of you and you are faced with the choice: to pay or not to pay?"
 parias_events.1.a.tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! pays §R[Root.paria_amount.GetValue]§! ¤ to §Y[paria_receiver.GetName]§!."
 parias_events.1.a: "Pay a quarter-year's income in full."
 parias_events.1.b.tt: "§Y[Root.GetName]§! pays §R[Root.paria_amount_halved.GetValue]§! ¤ to §Y[paria_receiver.GetName]§!."
 parias_events.1.b: "Pay only an eighth-year's income from the treasury, and tax the people for the rest."
 parias_events.1.c.tt: "§OThis may incur a declaration of war by [paria_receiver.GetName].§!"
 parias_events.1.c: "We shall not pay a tribute!"
 parias_events.2.t: "A Paria Challenged"
 parias_events.2.d: "The nation of [From.GetName], who has long paid us tribute, has just refused to do so, sending back our envoy rejected."
 parias_events.2.a: "To war we march!"
 parias_events.2.b.tt: "§YOOnly with this Casus Belli we can restore the Paria upon [From.GetName].§!"
 parias_events.2.b: "Perhaps some diplomacy can settle this."
 parias_events.3.t: "The Christian Response"
 parias_events.3.d: "The nation of [From.GetName] has responded to our refusal to pay our paria by declaring war. May they perish in flames!"
 parias_events.3.a: "Fools!"
 parias_events.4.t: "The Christian Response"
 parias_events.4.d: "The nation of [From.GetName] has responded to our refusal to pay our paria. The heathen cowards decided to not declare war. May our people be free and glorious!"
 parias_events.4.a: "Fools!"
 parias_events.5.t: "The End of the Paria"
 parias_events.5.d: "Recent political developments in Iberia have ensured that no Christian nation will demand the shameful paria tribute from us anymore. Those idiots have exploited us long enough!"
 parias_events.5.a: "They shall grovel before our majesty!"
 parias_events.6.t: "Paria Received"
 parias_events.6.d: "By the rightful majesty of our glorious nation, [From.GetName] has given us the tribute that the heathen scum can only but wish to pay. It is their disgusting salvation."
 parias_events.6.a: "Collect the Paria"
 parias_events.6.tt: "§Y[From.GetName]§! pays §Y[Root.paria_amount.GetValue]§! ¤ to §Y[Root.GetName]§!."
 parias_events.7.tt: "§Y[From.GetName]§! pays §Y[Root.paria_amount_halved.GetValue]§! ¤ to §Y[Root.GetName]§!."
#Pirates
 pirates.2.d: "Algiers has fallen! The pirates of the Maghreb have become so emboldened by the absence of civilized government in the region that they have overrun the fort and proclaimed a Republic of Pirates.\n\nChief among them is the pirate captain Hayreddin Barbarossa, born Khidr Yakupoglu. Barbarossa maintains a tenuous leadership over the traitors and criminals of the city; the ruthless lieutenants under his command watch him closely for signs of weakness.\n\nThis 'Republic of Pirates' is not only a violation of our sovereignty over the Maghreb, but an affront to all civilized peoples. Anarchy reigns in Algiers."
 pirates.3.t: "Maniot Piracy"
 pirates.3.d: "The Maniots, who live at the southernmost end of the Peloponnese peninsula, have always been a strange group. The rough Taygetus Mountains have not only protected them from external intervention for centuries, but have also been a place of refuge for expelled people.\n\nAlthough they are de facto part of our [Root.GovernmentName], they have repeatedly attacked our merchant ships recently, confiscating their cargo, and even captured some of our galleys. It will be difficult to convince them to stop harassing our ships and coasts and make them recognize us as their rightful sovereigns again."
 pirates.3.b: "We will put an end to them once and for all."
 pirates.4.d: "The zealous Spanish Inquisition continues to ruthlessly purge and deport the Moriscos, the descendants of converts whom they suspect of hiding their Muslim faith. A large group of wealthy Moriscos from the province of [1212.GetName] have fled [1212.Owner.GetName] in anticipation of further oppression.\n\nThey have settled in Salé, where they have abandoned their former lives and adopted a new profession; high seas piracy. Joined by a host of piratical slavers, the newly formed Republic of Salé is led by the Dutch pirate Jan Janszoon, now calling himself by his Muslim name Murat Reis.\n\nWe should take these ambitious refugees under our wing. After all, the enemy of our enemy is our friend."
 pirates.6.t: "The Pirates of Gotland"
 pirates.6.d: "We have awarded a great number of letters of marque to enterprising privateers in the Baltic with the goal of harassing [spanish_main_country.GetAdjective] shipping. These privateers have made their home in the town of [2697.GetName] on Gotland, where they have found great opportunity for plunder.\n\nThe willingness of Gotland's authorities to deal in stolen goods has also attracted a less savory sort; pirates who bear no letter of marque and recognize no sovereign have begun to make their bases on the island. The appeals of lawlessness have not been lost on our privateers; several have already abandoned their commissions and turned pirates. The gossip in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is that Gotland has become a pirate utopia, a Sodom of the Baltic Sea."
 pirates.6.b: "We must restore order in Gotland."
 pirates.7.t: "Anglo-Saxon Exiles"
 pirates.7.d: "After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the arduous pacification of the kingdom began when numerous Earls tried to regain power. Meanwhile, a small group of Earls left England to avoid subjugation and sailed to the Black Sea coast, where they were promised land by the Byzantine Emperor.\n\nWithout our consent, they landed on our coast, where, due to their superior equipment, they took over part of our territory. There they have begun to build their own Anglo-Saxon cities and live out their strange culture and religion."
 pirates.7.b: "They will pay for this."
 pirates.8.t: "Dalmatian Piracy"
 pirates.8.d: "The coastal town of Omiš, which we own, has been home to corsairs for quite some time, who make the surrounding waters unsafe. Strangely enough, they have not attacked a single one of our merchant ships; Venetian ships are their most common prey.\n\nTherefore, our advisors are divided on how to deal with these corsairs. We could make friends with these corsairs, or we ensure their expulsion from Omiš. How do we decide?"
 pirates.8.b: "They will no longer find refuge in Omiš."
 pirates.9.t: "Arumer Zwarte Hoop"
 pirates.9.d: "After a [frisian_enemy.GetAdjective] regiment devastated several Frisian villages and farmsteads of our countryside, a group of angry peasants and lesser nobles gathered around farmer Pier Gerlofs Donia, himself a victim of the [frisian_enemy.GetAdjective] pillaging. The group has formed its own army of mercenaries and has marched into battle against the [frisian_enemy.GetAdjective] army to take revenge.\n\nBoth on land and at sea, this 'Arumer Zwarte Hoop' has achieved an unusually large number of victories against our enemies in only a short time. Our advisors now propose to bring Pier Gerlofs Donia and his retinue to court to hire them."
 pirates.9.b: "Let them lead our nation."
 pirates.9.c: "We will recruit them into the army."
 pirates.20.t: "The Black Monk"
 pirates.20.d: "The constant clashes between and within England and France have created a dangerous environment in the English Channel. Whereas in the past merchants and other civilian vessels could safely pass through the strait, nowadays pirates and privateers, usually hired by either English or French lords, roam the sea.\nA former monk who studied black magic in Spain in his youth, has lived as a bandit for a long time after being robbed of his murdered father's possessions. Spurred on by his grudge against feudal lords and supported by the local pirates, he recently took the unguarded islands of the English Channel with his gang.\nIt is certain that this notorious man will further worsen the situation in the English Channel for righteous people."
 pirates.21.t: "Return to Cilician Piracy?"
 pirates.21.d: "Triggered by the decline of the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BC, Cilicia developed into a stronghold for well-organized piracy. Over time, the pirates established bases as far away as Gibraltar and had more than 1000 ships specialized in conquest, plunder and boarding. According to Plutarch, even Caesar was captured by the Cilician pirates on a voyage to Rhodes. Only a massive fleet of Romans under Pompey was able to destroy the pirates in 67 BC.\nWith the decline of the Byzantine Empire, we find ourselves in a similar situation. We could take the nearly insane step of raising the black flag on our ships, reviving our ancient heritage."
#Shinto Nestorian Events
 shinto_events.1.t: "Hereditary Patriarchate"
 shinto_events.1.d: "The sitting Patriarch of the Church of the East, Shemon IV, has made the unprecedented decision to declare the Patriarchal Seat hereditary, and plans to pass it on to one of his relatives.\nMany Nestorians are outraged by this decision, but the Patriarchate nevertheless commands wide respect and obedience. This could eventually result in a full blown schism if we are not careful."
 shinto_events.1.a: "Denounce the nepotistic Patriarch!"
 shinto_events.1.b: "We can learn to live with this"
 shinto_events.2.t: "Contacts With Rome"
 shinto_events.2.d: "The unrest caused by the Patriarchal switch to hereditary succession has spurred some of the disaffected parties to turn back to the Roman Pontiff. Refusing to recognize the legitimacy of the Patriarch of the East, they obtain their ordinations from the Pope himself."
 shinto_events.2.a: "Permit it, for now"
 shinto_events.2.b: "We should start doing the same"
 shinto_events.2.c: "Execute these traitors!"
 shinto_events.3.t: "A Chaldean Church?"
 shinto_events.3.d: "It has become clear that the differences in agreement between the hereditary Patriarchate and its discontents are insurmountable. In fact, the clerics who have been turning towards Rome for ordination are now attempting to found their very own separate church that will be oriented Westward. This new church is called the Chaldean Catholic Church."
 shinto_events.3.a: "Consider us Chaldeans"
 shinto_events.3.b: "Good riddance to them"
 shinto_events.3.c: "I thought I said execute them?"
 shinto_events.4.t: "Chaldeans Prevail"
 shinto_events.4.d: "Our continued support for the Chaldean cause and condemnation of the Eliya line has resulted in the virtual overthrow of traditional Church practice in favor of a new Chaldean Rite, in closer contact with the Roman Papacy."
 shinto_events.4.a: "To new friends"
 shinto_events.5.t: "A House Divided"
 shinto_events.5.d: "The fate of the Church of the East remains murky, as both supporters of the traditional Eliya line and of the new Chaldean Shimun line have wide currency in our realm. For now, we must tolerate both of them and accept that it is time to move on."
 shinto_events.5.a: "We will survive"
 shinto_events.6.t: "End of the Schism"
 shinto_events.6.d: "Our tenacity in fighting the Chaldeans and Shimun line has resulted in its effective defeat in our lands and amount our peoples. The unified Church of the East remains, under one autonomous and legitimate Patriarch, the highest authority in all the lands."
 shinto_events.6.a: "True faith prevails"
 shinto_events.7.t: "The Rise of Regionalism"
 shinto_events.7.d: "The most important thing in any church is its unity, and this is no different for the Church of the East. Lately, however, regionalist and nationalistic sentiments have caused fractures to appear in the overarching church body. Different ethnic groups located in different parts of the Nestorian world are seeking further and further autocephalous privileges."
 shinto_events.7.a: "This will erode the faith"
 shinto_events.7.b: "Every city a Church"
 shinto_events.8.t: "Josephites"
 shinto_events.8.d: "An upstart group in Mesopotamia has gone as far as to found what they call a new legitimate line of Chaldean Patriarchs of the East, the Josephites. They encourage all of the faithful to switch allegiance to Patriarch Joseph I and hail him as the head of the church, denying the authenticity of the current Shimun line, which they claim has drifted away from Rome!"
 shinto_events.8.a: "More Catholic unionists?"
 shinto_events.8.b: "Let's listen to what he has to say"
 shinto_events.9.t: "Sectarian Tension"
 shinto_events.9.d: "This new rift between the Josephites and the original Shimun Patriarchal line has been causing tensions in some of our cities. It has come to our attention that traders from a Josephite area provoked a conflict that turned into an all-out riot in which dozens of people were killed.\nSurely this act cannot go unpunished?"
 shinto_events.9.a: "Let the Holy Father sort it out"
 shinto_events.9.b: "Investigate the perpetrators"
 shinto_events.9.c: "Who cares about the rabble?"
 shinto_events.10.t: "The Church is Fractured"
 shinto_events.10.d: "Our apathy toward regionalist tendencies and refusal to turn Westward in search of unifying principles has left the Church of the East separated into several competing Patriarchal lines situated in different locales, each with contradictory creeds and degrees of autocephaly. Given this condition, the Holy Father has little hope of steering the faith as a whole towards Rome."
 shinto_events.10.a: "And that's a good thing"
 shinto_events.11.t: "A Careful Status Quo"
 shinto_events.11.d: "The regionalism that has rocked the church in recent years has been somewhat controlled. Though the fervor is still detectably, the peoples of the different corners of our realm have accepted compromises allowing for some local autocephaly while still remaining under the jurisdiction of a high Patriarch."
 shinto_events.11.a: "Well handled"
 shinto_events.12.t: "Unity Under Rome"
 shinto_events.12.d: "By crushing the petty traditionalists that have assaulted the church in the last decade, we have preserved our faith in a freshly Rome-oriented manner. The Holy Father was crucial in using his apostolic legitimacy and resources to help the Josephite Patriarch hold onto his power and to stop the rabble from destroying the new universal church."
 shinto_events.12.a: "A new future awaits"
 shinto_events.13.t: "Timur the Lame"
 shinto_events.13.d: "Despite his nickname, the Turkic warlord Timur is no laughing matter. He has unified much of Eastern Persia under his banner, and has made it his mission to erase the Christian faith off the face of the earth and enforce the Mohammedian heathenry on all of us! Tales are told about his massacring of entire cities without the slightest care."
 shinto_events.13.a: "Beg the Roman Pope for help"
 shinto_events.13.b: "Let us pray he won't attack"
 shinto_events.13.c: "We will fight to the last man"
 shinto_events.14.t: "The Sack of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 shinto_events.14.d: "Our worst fears have come true. Tamerlane, like a demon sent to destroy our sinful realm, has led a raiding party into the heart of our nation and sacked [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], taking mountains of loot and slaves. The Holy Church was desecrated, and smaller parishes were burned to the ground.\nFor many, this is a sign from God that we have strayed from the true faith."
 shinto_events.14.a: "Start rebuilding immediately"
 shinto_events.14.b: "Christ suffered too"
 shinto_events.14.c: "We must turn to Rome"
 shinto_events.15.t: "Convert or Die"
 shinto_events.15.d: "Tamerlane himself has sent an ultimatum to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName]. We are to convert to the Muslim faith, profess the Shahada, and transform all our Nestorian churches into mosques immediately.\nIf we do not promptly obey, Tamerlane warns, the streets of our cities will run red with the blood of martyrs, including our very own [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] entire extended family."
 shinto_events.15.a: "The Church is ruined!"
 shinto_events.15.b: "We can pretend to convert"
 shinto_events.15.c: "It's a bluff"
 shinto_events.16.t: "The Scourge is Lifted"
 shinto_events.16.d: "At long last, Tamerlane's raids and invasions have ceased in our lands. Though he was a powerful foe of the true faith, his threats turned out to be largely empty, and the one Nestorian Church remains as strong as ever. We have demonstrated the zeal of the East, and the fact that we will not trade our sovereignty for assistance."
 shinto_events.16.a: "Ring the bells"
 shinto_events.17.t: "Tamerlane's Shadow"
 shinto_events.17.d: "Though Tamerlane has at long last ceased his harrowing of our realm, the memory of him looms over the populace. There are few families that didn't count among them a martyr, or lose their property to his Turkish marauders. Tamerlane has been a blight on the Church of the East that will remain on our conscience for centuries to come."
 shinto_events.17.a: "By God's grace"
 shinto_events.18.t: "The Church Has Been Humbled"
 shinto_events.18.d: "Tamerlane's relentless onslaught and our inability to mount an effective local defense has spelled the virtual demise of the Church of the East in Persia and the rest of Asia. With our numbers greatly reduced, the Church is closer to the orbit of Rome than ever, as many see the still rich and powerful Catholic Church as the only option for future protection."
 shinto_events.18.a: "What shame"
 shinto_events.19.t: "Abbasids Demand Jizya"
 shinto_events.19.d: "Those faithful to the Church of the East living under the nominal rule of the Abbasid Caliph have long been used to the mere ceremonial nature of the Caliphal office, after the Caliphate disintegrated centuries ago. Now, however, the power of the Caliphs is waxing and they have dared to demand further payments of the Jizya tax from the already tax-laden peasants.\nA lowly ambassador has come to us asking for help and guarantees in the face of these Abbasid presumptions."
 shinto_events.19.a: "Render Unto Caesar..."
 shinto_events.19.b: "Do everything in our power"
 shinto_events.20.t: "Shari'a Courts"
 shinto_events.20.d: "The persecuted Nestorians living under the heathens are now telling us that they have often been forced to solve legal disputes in Islamic Shari'a courts, according to Islamic law. This is in contrast with certain ancient rights given to Christian minorities allowing a degree of self-governance. Clearly the new Caliphs seek to put pressure on the Christian faith and erode the foundations of the Church of the East."
 shinto_events.20.a: "They should leave for the West"
 shinto_events.20.b: "We must condemn the Caliph"
 shinto_events.21.t: "Caliphal Depositions"
 shinto_events.21.d: "A great outrage has rocked the Church of the East - the current Sunni Caliph has forced the deposition of the Nestorian Patriarch! The Caliph accused the Patriarch with trumped up charges, but in reality was afraid of the Patriarch's anti-Abbasid stances and the mass of angry citizens that were being riled up by his sermons.\nThe Caliph does not expect us to dare question his actions, but our legitimacy will be greatly shaken in the minds of many Nestorians if we do not join other Church leaders in denouncing this action and demanding the re-instatement of the old Patriarch."
 shinto_events.21.a: "The Pope is our only hope"
 shinto_events.21.b: "Send a petition ourselves"
 shinto_events.22.t: "Caliphal Authority Triumphs"
 shinto_events.22.d: "The Caliphs persistence in persecuting the Holy Church of the East has led to widespread dejection among the Nestorian peoples. Many have turned to Rome as a beacon of Christian power in the face of the great Islamic Empire, and hope we can be more cooperative with the Holy Father in the future."
 shinto_events.22.a: "So it goes"
 shinto_events.23.t: "An Uneasy Truce"
 shinto_events.23.d: "The conflict between the Caliphs and local Nestorians has come to something of a stalemate. We have not been able to convince the Caliphs to give up their attempts to control and legislate our people, but the Caliphs are cautious to attempt any more persecutions due to the fear of an outright revolution sponsored by our state church. It is unsure whether this should be counted as a loss or victory."
 shinto_events.23.a: "A victory"
 shinto_events.24.t: "Caliphs Rebuked"
 shinto_events.24.d: "The arrogant Caliphs have found widespread condemnation and civic disobedience as a result of their attempts to persecute the faithful. Without the military power to truly exert their authority in Nestorian lands, they have been forced to back down on all their pretensions and restore the sovereignty of the Church of the East."
 shinto_events.24.a: "Thank Christ"
 shinto_events.25.t: "Silk Road Trade"
 shinto_events.25.d: "For millennia the Silk Road has provided trade opportunities between the Western and Eastern worlds, and facilitated the exchange of cultures and traditions. While it has been a great instrument for the dissemination of Nestorian theology throughout Central Asia and even China, it also means strange traditions from these lands can reach our people as well. The Roman Emperors were extremely wary of the power foreign religions like Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism had over their subjects and frequently tried to quash and ban them."
 shinto_events.25.a: "Restrict foreign trade"
 shinto_events.25.b: "Leave things alone"
 shinto_events.25.c: "Promote foreign trade"
 shinto_events.26.t: "Saint Thomas Church"
 shinto_events.26.d: "Traders from India have brought word of the strangest thing - a massive Nestorian Christian community in the southern coasts of their country which was allegedly founded by Saint Thomas himself when he evangelized in those areas. They have remained largely out of contact with the central Church of the East Patriarchal structure, but if we could foster greater connections we could bring them into the fold with us.\nSome local traders are standing by, waiting for our word whether they should seek out this mysterious community of Indian Christians."
 shinto_events.26.a: "Sounds dubious"
 shinto_events.26.b: "Wait for more information"
 shinto_events.26.c: "We must welcome them"
 shinto_events.27.t: "Indian Envoy"
 shinto_events.27.d: "It turns out the stories of Saint Thomas' church were correct. A Raja from the Malabar coast of India has arrived in person at the Patriarchal palace, attesting his Christian orthodoxy and asking for the Patriarch's blessing. With him are several Indian bishops who seek official ordination from our Patriarch, and a variety of scribes who will work on establishing a common creed across our communities."
 shinto_events.27.a: "Send them away"
 shinto_events.27.b: "Wonderful"
 shinto_events.28.t: "Traders Injured"
 shinto_events.28.d: "An incident occurred in one of our main cities a few weeks ago in which some Silk Road traders from Central Asia were involved in a brawl. The local magistrate ignored their plight and refused to entertain any of their pleas for a criminal investigation or justice. Word has spread quickly, and it seems the traders have already told their compatriots about our realm's hostility to foreigners.\nIf the story of this scandal continues to spread, it could undermine the confidences of foreign investors who prop up much of our local economy, and leave the realm in isolated disgrace under the weight of boycotts and fear. What should be done to remedy the situation?"
 shinto_events.28.a: "We don't need their money"
 shinto_events.28.b: "Remove the magistrate and apologize"
 shinto_events.29.t: "The Church Remains Pure"
 shinto_events.29.d: "Our continued rejection of overtures to debase the Holy Church of the East with strange foreign customs and heretical communities has preserved our status as a truly Western body. We may be called the Church of the East, but the Mediterranean is the heart of the Christian world, not the Indian Ocean!"
 shinto_events.29.a: "Good developments"
 shinto_events.30.t: "Times Are Changing"
 shinto_events.30.d: "Though we have been cautious about accepting the role of stewards of a pan-Asian church, some degree of unity between disparate Eastern Christian traditions has been achieved. Bringing so many new people into the fold of Mesopotamia, even if their beliefs aren't quite orthodox, has been a great victory."
 shinto_events.30.a: "We must accept things"
 shinto_events.31.t: "Eastern At Heart"
 shinto_events.31.d: "With the Saint Thomas Christians now brought into communion with the Nestorian Patriarch, and believes from Beijing to Khwarezm professing allegiance to our church, the Church of the East is stronger and more Oriental than ever. At last we have truly lived up to our name."
 shinto_events.31.a: "Let them all convert!"
 shinto_events.32.t: "Nestorian Mongols"
 shinto_events.32.d: "For many in Europe and the Near East, the arrival of the Mongol Hordes was a cataclysmic event that resulted in the complete destruction of cities and entire empires. For the Church of the East, however, it was the greatest of boons, as many Mongol Khans came to accept and practice the faith, including the legendary Ilkhan Hülegü, who famously sacked Baghdad and trampled the Sunni Caliph to death inside a carpet, effectively destroying all remaining Caliphal power.\nThe Mongols have thus effected an explosion in the popularity of the Church of the East across the world, turning it into the most widely practiced Christian sect."
 shinto_events.32.a: "The East will be our cradle"
 shinto_events.32.b: "We must remember our Western roots"
 shinto_events.33.t: "Tengri Syncretism"
 shinto_events.33.d: "It has come to the attention of Church officials that some Mongol Khans who profess to follow the Nestorian creed are in fact practicing it in tandem with bizarre pagan and traditional belief systems borne out of their native Mongolia. We must decide whether to excommunicate them for their practices or teleologically accept this syncretic style of worship."
 shinto_events.33.a: "Excommunicate them!"
 shinto_events.33.b: "We can't afford to lose them"
 shinto_events.34.t: "Rising Popularity of Islam"
 shinto_events.34.d: "The Mongols are increasingly turning towards Islam, which they once considered a foreign barbarism and sought to destroy. It would be a travesty for the Church of the East if they abandoned our patronage and instead worshipped the unholy trinity of Allah, Baphomet, and Termagant!\nOur most skilled preachers may be able to coax the Mongols away from this gravely mistaken path and restore the supremacy of the Church of the East as sovereign of all Asia."
 shinto_events.34.a: "Let it go"
 shinto_events.34.b: "Use any means to convince them"
 shinto_events.35.t: "Mongols Slip Away"
 shinto_events.35.d: "Between their love of pagan traditions and Islamic heathenry, most now view the Mongols as a lost cause when it comes to the long-term survival of the Church of the East. Instead, turning back toward Rome may be our best bet in keeping the Christian faith strong in the Near East."
 shinto_events.35.a: "So be it"
 shinto_events.36.t: "Mongol Piety Wanes"
 shinto_events.36.d: "Though their have not completely abandoned the true faith, the nobility that rules within the Mongol states is not as fervent in their support for the Church of the East as they once were. This is a problem, but it is one that we can overcome if we are tenacious enough. For now, we must move on."
 shinto_events.36.a: "Sad!"
 shinto_events.37.t: "Mongol Support Cemented"
 shinto_events.37.d: "The nobility of the Khans, through our accommodation and diplomatic maneuvering, remains as sympathetic to the Church of the East as ever. We thus maintain profound institutional power and support in the Asian continent, without needing to rely on foreign agents like the Bishops of Constantinople and Rome."
 shinto_events.37.a: "A triumph"
 shinto_events.38.t: "The Cult of Mary"
 shinto_events.38.d: "The Virgin Mary, mother of God, has become hugely influential in the Western Catholic Church. Mary is venerated everywhere, and every cathedral city is marked by an 'Our Lady' or 'Notre Dame' church. Extensive theological debates have occurred over the immaculate conception, the annunciation, the ensoulment and embodiment of Christ, the act of birth, et cetera. This treatment of Mary as a supreme intercessory being - the Queen of Heaven itself - has started to spread even to our Nestorian lands among certain classes of people."
 shinto_events.38.a: "Welcome the change"
 shinto_events.38.b: "Issue no comment"
 shinto_events.38.c: "This is heresy!"
 shinto_events.39.t: "No Other God Before Me"
 shinto_events.39.d: "The popularity of Marian worship has caused a significant reactionary movement within the Church of the East, who decry it as a form of apotheosis in which Mary has taken on the role of a Goddess. To them, this Marian veneration goes against the very core tenets of the Eastern Church and is a pathetic bit of cultural imperialism from Rome that must be combatted on all fronts."
 shinto_events.39.a: "They have a point"
 shinto_events.39.b: "Let them complain"
 shinto_events.39.c: "Silence them"
 shinto_events.40.t: "A Papal Envoy"
 shinto_events.40.d: "The Pope of Rome has sent an envoy to us to celebrate the Feast of Mary. His Holiness is pleased that Marian devotion is taking off within our lands, and hopes it will lead to further cooperation between our two churches in the future. The anti-Marian majority, however, are angry at the envoy's presence and demand he be banished from the capital at once.\nThese angry factions threaten to banish him themselves, in no gentle manner, if we do not cave to their demands."
 shinto_events.40.a: "Make him return to Rome"
 shinto_events.40.b: "He should stay"
 shinto_events.41.t: "Ave Maria"
 shinto_events.41.d: "A certain Syriac composer has developed a song in Aramaic celebrating the Holy Virgin that has become popular amongst the lower classes. The song is praised for its sublime gentleness and emotional potency, and it was reported that even Muslims were moved to tears at this ode to Isa's mother Mariyya.\nPotentially, this song could be integrated into the Eastern cultural tradition and be permitted at Mass."

 shinto_events.45.d: "A Marian ceremony in a certain village prompted a scuffle when an angry mob, disapproving of the practice, attempted to put an end to it. This has caused extensive property damage in the village and has greatly alienated the local community of Catholics."
 shinto_events.45.a: "Denounce it"
 shinto_events.45.b: "Who cares?"
 shinto_events.47.t: "Marian Cult Triumphs"
 shinto_events.47.d: "By supporting this wonderful innovation in church practice, the Marian tradition of Western Christianity has been brought to the Church of the East as well. We can all share in the mercy and kindness of Christ's mother, whose passion nearly matched that of Christ himself on the cross.\n\nHail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee..."
 shinto_events.47.a: "Blessed art thou amongst women"
 shinto_events.48.t: "Marian Fervor Has Passed"
 shinto_events.48.d: "By carefully balancing our position between the pro-Marian factions and anti-Marian factions, we have managed to survive this conflict without alienating either side. The veneration of Mary has died down a bit, allowing most people to forget about the whole controversy and go back to life as usual."
 shinto_events.48.a: "Enlightened centrism prevails"
 shinto_events.49.t: "Marian Cult Erased"
 shinto_events.49.d: "By cracking down on this heretical and blasphemous deification of Mary that has weaseled its way into our realm from the Franks, we have preserved the orthodoxy and unity of the Church of the East free from vile foreign influences. God will surely reward us for not giving in to these temptations."
 shinto_events.49.a: "Crush all memory of it"
 shinto_events.50.t: "Iconoclasm"
 shinto_events.50.d: "A copy of the Peshitta, the Syriac Bible used by the Church of the East, was publicly burned recently because it was filled with iconographic motifs and illuminations. The rabble that burned it cited a trusted local cleric who claimed that the veneration of images runs contrary to the Holy Commandments and is tantamount to idolatry.\nThis incident is part of a string of increasingly severe iconoclastic riots across the Nestorian world, which seek to move away from the Icon and Veneration based worship so core to the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions."

 shinto_events.50.b: "Give a slap on the wrist"
 shinto_events.50.c: "Why not burn the cleric?"
 shinto_events.51.t: "Islamic Legal Influences"
 shinto_events.51.d: "Much of the iconoclastic fury in Nestorian culture can be attributed to the profound influence Islamic civilizations and cultures have had on our people. Promoting iconoclasm, and indeed banning the use of figural images outright, can be taken as a move away from the sphere of the West and towards the sphere of the Islamic world.\nSome would consider that a betrayal of our identity, but many see it as a practical unity with our true ethnic brothers and sister."

 shinto_events.52.t: "The Church of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 shinto_events.52.d: "[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is home to one of the most beautiful churches in all the Nestorian world. The nave is decorated with extensive ancient frescos showing the evangelists, Christ, and many stories from the Old and New Testaments. Travelers come from around the world just to lay eyes upon its incredible artwork and miraculous icons.\nIconoclasts, however, are having none of this. They demand that the church's art be covered up with plaster in favor of a plain design that matches the humility and simplicity of Christ and his apostles. To bow to their demands would not only ruin this great art, but also wrack up a considerable renovation cost."
 shinto_events.52.a: "There is no price on salvation"
 shinto_events.52.b: "Ignore them"
 shinto_events.55.t: "End of Iconoclasm"
 shinto_events.55.d: "We have remained true to the traditions of other Eastern Christians and to the Roman Pope by crushing these fanatical vandals who sought to destroy all the beautiful art and icons that make our church so prestigious. The Holy Father will be extremely pleased to hear of the result of this controversy."
 shinto_events.55.a: "Pray to the Pantokrator"
 shinto_events.56.t: "Compromise Reached"
 shinto_events.56.d: "Neither the iconophilic or iconoclastic factions have received unconditional support from our state, and thus the two parties have been forced to come to certain compromises over the veneration of icons and other images. We have preserved the Church of the East in something of state of status quo."
 shinto_events.56.a: "Caution pays off"
 shinto_events.57.t: "End of Icon Worship"
 shinto_events.57.d: "By supporting new laws in our realm criminalizing the worship and veneration of icons and other graven images, we have moved the Church of the East toward a new iconoclastic standard that puts it in total contrast to other Eastern churches and even the Catholics of Rome."

 sufi_order_events.1.d: "Part of the duties of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in guiding the Ummah within [Root.GetName] is the maintenance and establishment of madrasas to teach the next generation of scholars. The heterodox leanings of our theocratic state, however, are often a source of criticism from more traditionalist scholars. With our next madrasa, we must decide whether to support Sufi-aligned esoteric schools of thought or more safe and widely-recognized forms of practice and jurisprudence."

Several neighboring states have had their best jurists prepare a denunciation of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the forms of Islamic observance [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] permits.\nWe can perhaps combat these accusations if we commission a respected scholar to comprehensively rebut them and explain how all supposedly 'Sufi' or heterodox beliefs we profess are actually justified by Quran and Hadith. This will be no cheap undertaking, however."

This is slightly problematic as these are people who have agreed to obey us in exchange for protection but the experience these warriors get in close combat could be useful to us."
 tengri_events.53.b: "We need new slaves!"
 tengri_events.55.d: "The people of [Root.GetName] have been organizing their resistance against our rule through the local holy places and many of their leaders are to be found in the local clergy. Assimilation will surely quieten them in the long run but for now our Kemetic priests suggest that we confiscate their [Root.Religion.GetName] idols, by protecting them in our capital we can ensure that the people of [Root.GetName] remember where the real power lies."

He offers his services at a discount, but it may give the wrong impression if we bow to his request - some may take it as favoritism or at best sentimentality.\n\nHow should we treat the Lala's plea?"

 turkish_government_events.2.d: "The peace viziers and war viziers are bitterly divided over what direction we should steer the state in. As usual, the pacifists urge us to focus on internal stability, reining in the many ethno-religious groups of our empire and ironing out problems with our administrative systems. The militarists denounce this as cowardice, and demand we focus on conquest, starting with rigorous training of our standing army."

The Sufis usually are content to live peaceful lives of mystical dhikr, but every once in a while someone like this man comes along - and the historical result has usually been a bloody revolution that overthrows the state.\n\nHow should we proceed?

Like Knights of the Christian West, richer soldiers can be assigned command positions and bring their own high-quality armor and weapons to the battlefield with them.

The cost of the whole conflict has been quite taxing on a state coffers and local populations, and one particular vizier's call for peace is gaining increasing momentum within the capital. On the other hand, there are rumors that the pacifists' opponents are plotting to murder this vizier on the grounds of cowardice and treason.

#Advisors
 vn_advisors.1.t: "Anna Komnene"
 vn_advisors.1.d: "Born as the eldest child of the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, Anna has lost her status as heir to the throne through the birth of her younger brother Kaloioannes. As the wife of Caesar Nikephoros Bryennios, she was interested in the quadrivium (geometry, arithmetic, astronomy and music), but also studied medicine. On top of that, she wrote a treatise on gout and ran a hospital in Constantinople. Anna simultaneously studied philosophy and was a follower of Christian Aristotelianism, which had neo-Platonic traits. Thus, a remarkable prosperity of Aristotelianism stemmed from a philosophical circle maintained by Anna Komnene, the daughter of the emperor who had so far been excluded from political life.\nIn the present times, however, when we are tumbling from one crisis to the next, it would certainly be worthwhile to allow her to return to imperial politics - either as advisor or even as heiress."
 vn_advisors.1.a: "Under her, the Byzantine Empire shall flourish again!"
 vn_advisors.1.b: "She is supposed to assist us as a capable advisor at court."
 vn_advisors.2.t: "Jeanne d'Arc"
 vn_advisors.2.d: "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], we have received a letter from the local commander of Vaucouleurs announcing a legendary young lady at our court. According to official records, she was named Jeanne at her baptism. But more important than her name are the rumors that are spreading about her. It is said that since the age of 13 she has been receiving visions of Saint Catherine, who told her to free France from its miserable situation. So she left her parental home at the age of 16 and requested an audience in Vaucouleurs, where she proved her immense piety and religiousness. Now she is on her way to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to speak to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself].\nSeveral of our subjects have lost their lives fighting the English, which is why the morale among our knights is low. However, with such a Holy Virgin in our service, who wishes to reconquer our beloved country in the name of Heaven and God, the war could turn in our favour and eventually drive the English entirely back to their island."
 vn_advisors.2.a: "Make an armor for her and put a small regiment at her side."

 vn_advisors.2.c: "She should become a nun."
 vn_advisors.3.t: "Hildegard von Bingen"
 vn_advisors.3.d: "Hildegard von Bingen had already spent her life in a monastery as a teenager. After she had received visions, she began to write down these and theological and anthropological ideas in Latin in 1141. Her main work Scivias ('Know the Ways') was written in a period of six years and contains 35 miniatures. These miniatures of theological content are extremely artistically painted in bright colours and serve mainly to illustrate the complicated and profound text.\nPope Eugene III gave her permission to publish her visions in 1147. Thanks to her political importance, she was soon able to found the monastery of Rupertsberg. Her extraordinary reputation helped Hildegard to acquire very extensive monastic estates. This increasing wealth also affects the life of the community and causes criticism. Thus, several clergymen, but also leaders of other communities attack Hildegard because her nuns, contrary to the evangelical advice of poverty, allegedly live luxuriously and only women from noble families are accepted in Rupertsberg. Nevertheless, Hildegard is one of the wisest women of the present, whose knowledge and influence we should exploit for ourselves."

 vn_advisors.4.d: "An interesting figure has recently come to the public eye. A nun gave up the lonely years in the monastery to help the poor and sick or to assist convicted criminals. Her charisma and her work led to the formation of a group around her, for whom Catherine became a spiritual mother. This group includes nuns, acquaintances, friends, Dominicans and staff of the Sienese hospitals. Catherine expresses herself not only on ecclesiastical issues but also in political and social matters, by giving public speeches and - if she felt it necessary precisely because of her attachment to the Church - also by sharp criticism of the ecclesiastical and political leaders.\nShould we support this impressive woman or send her back to the monastery?"
 vn_advisors.4.a: "Transfer the leadership of our [Root.GovernmentName] to her."

Many times, she accompanies her husband during his conquests in southern Italy, such as during the siege of Trani. In the Battle of Dyrrhachium in 1081, she stood in full armour on the field and gathered her and Robert's troops, when they were first repulsed by the Byzantine army and in danger of losing cohesion. Our enemies refer to her as like another Pallas, if not a second Athena. Which is the best way to make use of this competent woman?"

According to her Vida, she is married to Guilhem de Poitiers, but she is in love with the troubadour Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, to whom she dedicates numerous songs.

To avoid this, we could declare the young princess Eleonore as heiress, whose beauty, intelligence and frankness are appreciated by the court officials. We are confident that she could lead Aquitaine as its Duchess to a dominant position within the French Kingdom."

From her father, she learned Islamic jurisprudence, the Quran and hadith at an early age so that she was able to issue fatwas. When Samarqandi became of an age suitable for marriage, many rich and powerful men asked for her hand. It is reported that kings and princes wanted to marry this intelligent and knowledgeable woman. But Samarqandi's father wanted better for her, so she married a scholar from Aleppo. Although her husband is well-educated and knowledgeable, Samarqandi's knowledge and jurisprudential ability surpass his. In fact, her husband often turns to her for advice on fatwas or other matters.\nShall we hire this strong, resilient and intelligent woman?"

It is evident that he has a brilliant mind; even the most esteemed scholars at the Nizamiyya are amazed by his insights.

After Shams' death, Rumi became the foremost master in the science of Tasawwuf, students coming to learn by his feet from all around the land of Islam. Now that he has met his Lord, we are informed of his magnum opus, a 24,000 verse work of Persian poetry that can humble the hardest of souls.

 vn_advisors.12.d: "The court advisors have come and explained to us the situation with a certain man called Ibn Rushd. Ibn Rushd, a Faylasuf in his creed, has made quite a scene in the field of Aqidah with his writings. He has written refutation of Imam Al-Ghazali's Tahafut, and expounded in length on the writings of Aristotle. His fame has even spread to the Christians, who have started calling him 'The Commentator'. We need to take a stance in the debate; either support Ibn Rushd and his philosophy, or back the rising tide of Ash'ari theologians."

The four bronze horses adorning the Hippodrome were stolen, as well as the Mandylion, a sacred icon. Countless other objects of value were either melted down or taken back to Western Europe. However, the resulting carnage at the hands of the Crusaders was to be even more shocking still. Nothing and no one was spared in their rampage which desecrated Hagia Sophia and massacred thousands within the city.\nThe glory of Constantinople has been effectively erased, and in its absence a power vacuum has swept through the region, providing fertile ground for the Crusaders to establish independent Latin kingdoms on what were once Greek lands.

There are rumors that the fearsome Norwegian King Harald Sigurdsson hopes to re-establish Viking rule over England based on a promise made to his predecessor, while the Duke of Normandy, whose court protected Eadweard for 25 years, also considers himself the rightful heir. One of the most powerful Earls in our lands is Hereweald, son of Godwin - though it would bring an end to the ancient line of the Cerdicingas, we could embrace him as a son in order to ensure the Anglo-Saxon people have a fighting chance against these barbaric pretenders."

We have received word that this rebellion was fomented by agents of the Scandinavians, who wish to see England returned to their control at any cost. It seems that [NOL.Monarch.GetName] is colluding with Norsemen both foreign and abroad to raise an army that can match that of our realm and help deliver it into servitude once again.

After being restored to the English throne, Eadweard was more concerned with piety than royal duties, and resented his powerful vassals - especially the ambitious Godwin family who held Earldoms in Wessex, East Anglia, and Northumbria. On this basis, he promised that upon his death the English crown would pass to his magnanimous cousin Guillaume de Normandie.\nThe day has finally come.

 vn_flavor_khr.3.d: "Uncertain about their future, several municipalities in Prättigau have united to form the League of the Ten Jurisdictions.

Furthermore, they have pledged to reaffirm this pact every twelve years, solidifying their independence and unity."

 vn_flavor_kie.1.t: "Metropolitan Hilarion"
 vn_flavor_kie.1.d: "Since the Christianization of the Rus, Greeks from the Byzantine Empire have occupied the office of Metropolitan of Kiev, appointed by the Patriarch of Constantinople. It was only at the request of Yaroslav the Wise in 1051 that Hilarion, the first Slavic bishop, was elected to this office by an assembly of Slavic bishops, marking a break with the old tradition.\nMany powerful Greek bishops of the Rus now fear that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] could continue this tradition of his predecessor, causing them to suspect gradual emancipation of the Russian Church. Consequently, they demand the deposition of Hilarion and the appointment of a Greek by the Patriarch of Constantinople and the promise to maintain ties with Byzantium."

Today, it consists of the most famous mayors, commanders, boyars and bishops of our nation and possesses a great deal of legislative and judicial power, especially in Novgorod. Favoured by the Rota system, the Veche alone has the right to appoint and depose our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s; it is a symbol of sovereignty and independence of the estates of Novgorod.\n\nIn recent years, the Veche of Novgorod has acquired much prominence while [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has gradually lost influence and approval among the estates of Novgorod. As a result, the Veche has convened in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to decide on the deposition of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."

[From.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] gave up [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] old title in [Root.GetName] and immediately departed to [From.Capital.GetName] for [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] coronation.

 vn_flavor_nor.1.d: "After the battle of Stiklestad in 1030, at which Harald fought and was badly wounded, he escaped from Norway and arrived in Kievan Rus, where he and a force of 500 men enlisted in the Varangian Guard of the Byzantine army. During his time in the East, Harald soon rose to prominence as being the principal leader of an effective fighting force, launching campaigns as far east as Mesopotamia against Arab strongholds. He also fought in theaters such as Sicily, Bulgaria and Jerusalem, winning glory and countless riches, so much so that he could use the funds to claim the Norwegian crown. At first, he was highly esteemed in the Byzantine court, but after internal strife led to a new Emperor who was more hostile to Harald, he had to flee Constantinople in 1042 and arrived in Sweden by 1046. There, he prepared to oust the then Norwegian king Magnus the Good, but Magnus instead agreed to a compromise where the two would rule Norway jointly. This fell through when Magnus suddenly died in 1047, and Harald was able to assume the role of king in full.\nWith such a legacy, it is no wonder then that Harald's military knowledge could prove very useful to us; we only need to decide which aspect of our army to prioritize."

 vn_flavor_pap.1.d: "The status of the Papacy within the Holy Roman Empire has always been dubious, as the donations of Pepin and Constantine and the nominal role of Rome as the Empire's capital muddy the waters regarding what degree of freedom we should have. With the Investiture Controversy in mind, and the rise of Guelph-Ghibelline strife across the Italian peninsula, perhaps it is time to seek de-jure independence from the conglomeration calling itself Holy and Roman."

 vn_flavor_pap.2.d: "In 1260 a holy woman arrived in Milan named Guglielma, and quickly gained a large following for her piety. Her disciples claimed she was the physical incarnation of the Holy Spirit and was destined to lead the Catholic Church as the first Popess. Though Guglielma denied this herself, she did preach an apocalyptic vision of the church, in which extant power structures would be torn down and replaced with an all-female clergy. Later frescos of Guglielma even display her ordaining women as priests.\n\nHow should the Papacy react to these outlandish notions?"
 vn_flavor_pap.2.a: "It is the will of the Holy Spirit"
 vn_flavor_pap.2.b: "This is heresy!"
 vn_flavor_pap.3.t: "The Dominicans"
 vn_flavor_pap.3.d: "A Spanish theologian named Dominic has established a small monastic community dedicated to scholarly and pedagogical matters. Many Christians look to Dominic's model with admiration, and seek to join this new way of life. The College of Cardinals sees no objection to granting Dominic's followers an official constitution and incorporating them as a new Order within the Catholic Church, the Ordo Praedicatorum. Their didactic talents will be useful in combating heresy."

 vn_flavor_pap.4.d: "The son of a wealthy merchant has donated all of his belongings to the poor and forsaken the very concept of property, aiming to live according to the model of Christ and his apostles. Unlike various heresies which tried to push a similar message, this Francis maintains strict obedience to the Catholic Church and the Roman Pontiff, which he enforces diligently upon his followers. In a dream last night, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] saw the Roman church crumbling to the ground, while Francis stood alone holding it up. That this was a vision from the Lord God is obvious - we must approve the mendicant's pending application for approval of his new order, the Ordo Fratrum Minorum."
 vn_flavor_pap.4.a: "He will surely be canonized!"
 vn_flavor_pap.5.t: "The Holy Inquisition"
 vn_flavor_pap.5.d: "For most of its history, the Catholic Church suppressed heresy with theological debate and, if that failed, condemnation and imprisonment. The rise of Catharism and Waldensianism simultaneously in Southern France presented a new challenge, as these traditional methods proved ineffective. In 1184, more drastic measures were taken with the establishment of the Episcopal Inquisition. Under this dictum, teams of two trained clerics would go city to city trying and punishing suspected heretics, with a maximum penalty of death by immolation.\nOver the centuries this innovation would see many uses, including a more violent state-run imitation in Christian Iberia, though it was originally maintained by monastic orders like the Dominicans. The effectiveness of the Dominican inquisition earned them the punning nickname 'Domini Canes' - 'Hounds of the Lord'."

For long we have struggled with [GAL.Monarch.GetHerHim] in minor skirmishes and trials by ordeal, but now we have the opportunity to sneak into the capital and arrest [GAL.Monarch.GetHerHim], sending all remnants of the old government into exile amongst the Moors.

In a lapse of judgment [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had launched a botched assassination attempt against the Leónese monarch, and now we have to pay the price as León sends a skirmishing force to our borders in the name of revenge.

Motivated by the desire for religious and pecuniary rewards, numerous holy orders were created, whose members promised to protect the Iberian pilgrimage routes, defend Christianity and expel the Moors from the peninsula. The Castilian Order of Calatrava, the Leonese Order of Alcántara, the Galician Order of Santiago, the Aragonese Order of Montesa and the Portuguese Order of Aviz belong to the most famous Iberian fraternities.\nInitially, these orders were mainly made up of former crusaders, however, by dint of papal privileges they quickly grew and would eventually consist of many Iberian nobles and knights. Through their encomiendas, these orders evolved not only into reliable soldiers of the Christian kingdoms during the Reconquista but also into key political and economic figures of Spain and Portugal whose influence would last for centuries."

Instead of appointing the king from West Francia as his successor, the East Frankish princes crowned one of their own, Duke Conrad I Konrading, as their new ruler. In the following decades, there were frequent changes of dynasty, as many kings left no direct male heir, which ultimately led to the creation of a permanent electoral college and the evolvement of an elective monarchy.\n\nDue to the political decline of an imperial elector, their electoral dignity has returned to the Empire and must be bestowed anew. Without a legal code on the exact rights and duties of the Electors, we can only act in a very limited way in this matter however.\nOur advisors have identified three of the most important and influential imperial princes who are now nominated to obtain the vacant electoral title.

Shortly thereafter, its first King Lothair divided the title further between his own three sons, establishing the Kingdom of Italy, Kingdom of Burgundy, and the Kingdom of Lotharingia. Over time, the Holy Roman Emperors, successors to the Kings of East Francia, integrated Italy back into their realm. It was only later still, in 1033 AD, that Burgundy rejoined the empire.\n\nAs Imperial authority in the south has waned in recent centuries, however, the Imperial titles 'King of Italy' and 'King of Burgundy' have become increasingly meaningless as each tract of land was partitioned further and further among local nobles.

He wants to be employed by the state as a special consultant, and promises us great success if we assign him on high-stakes naval missions. Many scoff at his attempts, however, explaining that you can never make such a vile criminal bow to the sacred offices of the [Root.GetAdjective] navy.\nOnce a pirate, always a pirate."

It has come to our attention now that the crew was successful in the endeavor, but driven mad by their lust for riches, have violated our lawful treaty and have made off with the money themselves, spending it haphazardly around the nation. We cannot let such an outrageous betrayal happen again!"

 vn_ideagroups.9.d: "Obviously in keeping the high standards of [Root.GetName] alive in reputation, we impose strict licenses surrounding such matters as shipbuilding. It follows that a black market has developed in turn to fund the building and repair of less legally-inclined sailing ventures. Now that we have opened channels with so-called 'pirates' and given them a legal protection for their actions, we could also try to harness the power of these illicit shipwrights under the proper circumstances.

 vn_ideagroups.12.d: "Scholars have long puzzled over the origin of the [Root.Culture.GetName] language. Suggestions range from Tamil to Macedonian to proto-Albanian to the hypothetical ur-ultrafrench. A new monograph, however, has discovered convincing comparative evidence that [Root.Culture.GetName] was indeed the first language of them all, having been spoken by the first humans ever to dwell on earth. Many already suspected as much, but this is fresh evidence to add to the pile."

 vn_ideagroups.13.d: "In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Wendish and Baltic lands experienced a surge of Germanization under what became termed the 'ostsiedlung' or 'east settling'. The people of our nation have developed a hunger to explore strange new lands, seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldly go where no man has gone before, marking the dawn of our own 'siedlung' golden age. We must encourage their enthusiasm!"

 vn_ideagroups.14.d: "A rich man in one of our cities has built up quite the collection of artifacts from our ancestors, a truly impressive monument to our cultural heritage. An earlier agreement involved a portion of state funds being set aside to construct a museum, allowing the populace at large to drink in the glory of our antique past. However, now that the rich owner is dead, there is nobody to enforce the deal. Should we still build the museum, or embezzle the funds for our own purposes?"

This outrageous claim flies in the face of our entire juridical tradition, which grants privileges to all the recognized Nations of [Root.GetName].

The idea turned out to be a wild success, invigorating the local economy and causing a massive boost in business. The festival was so popular, in fact, that word spread to neighboring nations of its incomparably delicious local cuisine showcases and haunting folk choirs. Travelers from around the region now come yearly to experience the celebration."

 vn_ideagroups.17.d: "A [Root.Culture.GetName] playwright has crafted a tour-de-force that will ring through the ages. This heartbreaking work brings tears to the eyes of the most stoic and heartless onlookers, and runs the gamut from comedy to romance to existentialism to tragedy with unsurpassed genius. One could almost pick out any line and have an intriguing, mellifluous epitaph for one's eternal remains.\nShould we continue to let the play run within our own borders, or try to fund the cast in a venture to one of our neighboring states? It will bring great glory to our people and nation."

 vn_ideagroups.17.b: "Send the troupe to another nation"
 vn_ideagroups.18.t: "An Amazing Discovery"
 vn_ideagroups.18.d: "Word of the New World has obviously spread across the West at this point in time. Our nation's scholars have found new evidence to support a contentious proposal that the Genovese explorer Christopher Columbus was not, in fact, the first to rediscover these lost continents - it was rather an ancient explorer born in our lands!\nAlready many naysayers have come out of the woodwork to denounce these findings as chauvinist fiction, but there may be a grain of truth to them."

 vn_ideagroups.19.d: "A top [Root.GetAdjective] statesman has been implicated in a massive scandal that threatens to bring down half the government if exposed. His misconduct will tarnish the reputation of the entire [Root.Culture.GetName] culture, so we must use any means necessary to make sure it doesn't get out.\nUnfortunately, the culprit has fled to some far away anarchic land, knowing he would be imprisoned or executed if he showed his face in our court. Our only option is to resort to the oldest method of persuasion short of a heavy club - bribery."

 vn_ideagroups.20.d: "Our advisors claimed that organizing a Tournament would signal the prestige of our nation and culture. It was expected, of course, that [Root.Heir.GetName] [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName] would take part, likewise proving his martial strength before he leads the realm. This rash idea has backfired, however, as he was badly wounded in an accident in front of the whole crowd. Not only is his reputation ruined, but the effects of the injury could be permanent!\n\nEvery advisor who supported this idea must be held accountable, through blood or at least exile."

 vn_ideagroups.21.d: "Our attention to logistical matters has already strengthened our martial prowess! Naysayers argued that we needed burlier soldiers or bigger catapults and cannons, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] was steadfast in defending the importance of our logistics officers. We have been proven right in the end!"
 vn_ideagroups.21.a: "We must celebrate"
 vn_ideagroups.22.t: "Intensify Training?"
 vn_ideagroups.22.d: "Certain logistics officers think we should issue a series of reforms to standard military training in the interest of professionalism and resilience. This would, however, lower the number of recruits passing the program, leaving us with a smaller pool from which to draw soldiers.\nThe logistics experts claim they can offset the difference with more recruitment drives, but we remain unconvinced that these reforms are in the best interest of the state."

 vn_ideagroups.23.t: "Logistically Talented General"
 vn_ideagroups.23.d: "Just as Scipio Africanus managed to escape from the Battle of Cannae, that paramount disaster for the Romans, and went on to defeat Hannibal Barca, sometimes one finds a military commander whose logistical talents are godly but who is less immediately noted for combat itself. One of our newest low-level generals has demonstrated an ability to pass through forests and over rivers like open roadways, and hop over fortress walls as if they were farmer's fences. Should we try to put him to use?"
 vn_ideagroups.23.a: "Recruit him"
 vn_ideagroups.23.b: "We have no need of his services"
 vn_ideagroups.24.t: "Logistically Talented Admiral"
 vn_ideagroups.24.d: "Like Aeneas in that great storm, slicing through the cobbled foam of the sea, our newest admiral is like a wizard with speed and planning. There is no port in the world, from Tangier to Taiwan, of which he is not aware, and no old sailors' trick he won't utilize.\nOf course, his talents in outright warfare are not so great, but perhaps we can put him to use?"
 vn_ideagroups.24.a: "Recruit him"
 vn_ideagroups.24.b: "We have no need of his services"
 vn_ideagroups.25.t: "Excellent Logistics"
 vn_ideagroups.25.d: "The logistics of [Root.GetName] are the envy of the region. Enter the royal courts, taverns, or military colleges of any neighboring state and you will hear awestruck discussion of how excellent our logistical branch is running. Some even whisper [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a soothsayer who can forsee the actions of hostile armies before they themselves have decided upon a course of action."
 vn_ideagroups.25.a: "Great"
 vn_ideagroups.26.t: "Secret Passages"
 vn_ideagroups.26.d: "Sometimes walled cities or castles would have a well-hidden passage, or even a long secret tunnel, leading in and out of them. Many important sieges in history have been successful due to traitors informing the besieging army of their location.\nWe can put such passages to use in another manner, though - to smuggle supplies inside the fort and relieve the starving inhabitants."
 vn_ideagroups.26.a: "Exploit them!"
 vn_ideagroups.26.b: "Keep the rations"
 vn_ideagroups.27.t: "Recruitment Booming"
 vn_ideagroups.27.d: "Logistics officers recently proposed a new propaganda campaign to drive recruitment. A series of pamphlets have been posted in various cities and villages showing the looming threat of our neighbors, their inherently villainous nature, and the dastardly evils they would perpetrate against our citizens if they ever broke through our defenses and ranks and made it into the countryside. The operation has been wildly successful, and recruitment numbers are way up!"
 vn_ideagroups.27.a: "Give our commendations"
 vn_ideagroups.28.t: "Contact Network Exposed"
 vn_ideagroups.28.d: "Having men on the inside is crucial in anticipating the movements and schemes of enemy states. Someones, when a network of informants gets too big, however, the whole thing is blown open and the turncoats are executed.\nIt seems that a certain official was bragging in a tavern last night about the power of our spy networks, and the wrong pair of ears overheard him."
 vn_ideagroups.28.a: "Heads will roll!"
 vn_ideagroups.29.t: "Logistics Neglected"
 vn_ideagroups.29.d: "Some people fail to see the importance of well-maintained logistical command, and think wars can be won by strength alone. This unfortunate malady seems to have stricken our own generals, and as such the logistical competence of our state has been compromised."
 vn_ideagroups.29.a: "Shameful"
 vn_ideagroups.30.t: "Bad Training"
 vn_ideagroups.30.d: "When you have a standing army or even just vassal levies, having some degree of standardized tactics and planning across the ranks is a logistical necessity. It would seem that some of our training programs are not quite up to snuff, leaving whole portions of the military in a state of decay."

 vn_ideagroups.31.t: "Enviable Artisans"
 vn_ideagroups.31.d: "The success of our artisanal class has become an inspiration across the realm. Taverns, shops, and trade posts overflow with high-quality locally-produced goods of every conceivable type, keeping the citizenry entertained and fed. As those old Romans said, all you really need to give the people is 'panem et circenses'."
 vn_ideagroups.31.a: "Wonderful!"
 vn_ideagroups.32.t: "Manufacturing Profits"
 vn_ideagroups.32.d: "There is no point to investing in manufacturing if the state doesn't benefit somehow.

How glad we are that they have been proven wrong!"
 vn_ideagroups.32.a: "We've got to have money"

 vn_ideagroups.33.d: "Midway on the journey through life a traveller from an antique land was passing through our glorious nation and came upon a farm that boasted a pig so large it dwarfed the local cows. This traveller's story eventually made it to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who sent representatives to investigate the claims. It turned out the traveller's story was true, and the pig and farmer alike were soon escorted to our capital for a public debut.\nThe [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is expected to make a speech to kick off the event, but it could potentially go in several directions."

 vn_ideagroups.34.t: "Supply Surplus"
 vn_ideagroups.34.d: "The excellent manufacturing policies of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] have led to a surplus of supplies. Wise advisors have suggested that we invest this surplus into our military, producing better equipped and better fed soldiers than we are usually wont to field. We should redistribute these new supplies immediately, for the glory of our state and people!"
 vn_ideagroups.34.a: "Support our troops"
 vn_ideagroups.35.t: "Trade Policy"
 vn_ideagroups.35.d: "The strength of our manufacturing sector and artisans has led to a trade surplus, and ministers have approached [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] with proposals to either focus on our grasp of local trade hubs or to try to flood neighboring markets with our cheap goods.\n\nIn which direction should we orient our traders?"
 vn_ideagroups.35.a: "Focus internally"
 vn_ideagroups.35.b: "Focus externally"
 vn_ideagroups.36.t: "New Manufacturing Policy?"
 vn_ideagroups.36.d: "A certain visiting consultant named Raghnall Ó Ríogáin has suggested we selectively implement a laissez-faire policy with regards to domestic manufacturers and artisans, to test the validity of new economic theories. According to Ríogáin, less regulation will promote growth and competition among local businesses, and the earnings will also trickle up to our coffers."
 vn_ideagroups.36.a: "Try it out"
 vn_ideagroups.36.b: "Stick with the status quo"
 vn_ideagroups.37.t: "Manufacturing Surplus"
 vn_ideagroups.37.d: "Our focus on manufacturing has paid off! Artisans in cities across the nation have had an exceptional year, from fine wine producers to beer brewers to herders and trappers and tailors and glass-blowers. The ebullience on the ground reaches the top echelons of our court, and even [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is in good spirits."
 vn_ideagroups.37.a: "Great news!"
 vn_ideagroups.38.t: "Supply Shortage"
 vn_ideagroups.38.d: "In times of war, one must hope the various cities and forts of the nation are well stocked for the event of a protracted siege.\nIt seems like this was not the case in our current war, as messengers from around the realm report severe supply shortages and a lack of manufactured goods. The populace is weary and many cities could end up surrendering without a fight."
 vn_ideagroups.38.a: "This is a disaster"
 vn_ideagroups.39.t: "Provinces Ravaged"
 vn_ideagroups.39.d: "Famine, fire, plague, and various horsemen of the apocalypse have taken their toll on our state's manufacturing sector. Stories circulate of 'ghost towns' that have been abandoned by their entire population due to dangerous surroundings or economic downturn. This problem runs to the root of our nation, and there is little we can do to remedy it."
 vn_ideagroups.39.a: "Pray for better times"
 vn_ideagroups.40.t: "Decaying Infrastructure"
 vn_ideagroups.40.d: "While our nation has dedicated a particular focus to manufacturing, we have largely overlooked the upkeep of our existing institutions. As such, many production houses around the fringes of civilization have reached quite a state of disrepair. Mills are rotting and neglected, granaries lay gutted by fire, fields are washed out by rains, and blacksmiths work with obsolete materials.\nTo remedy the situation would take a herculean effort... should we attempt to assuage these woes?"

#Irish High Kingdom
 vn_ire_kingdom.1.t: "A New High King"
 vn_ire_kingdom.1.d: "The death of the last High King of Ireland has raised the question of who should succeed in this prestigious title. Succession in Irish society has always been murky, and the legal concept of High Kingship even murkier, but the general understanding of the present age is that the title should pass from parent to child unless any other claimants can usurp it through force of power.\n\nIt now seems that we still hold the position of High Kings, but it remains to be seen if any rivals will try to steal it from us by seizing upon this opportunity."

In reality, the legal status of the High Kingship has been uncertain since Brian Boru usurped the title from the ancient Uí Néill sept before dying at the Battle of Clontarf. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] could very well claim the title himself if he could prove his mastery over the current pretenders by forcing them to submit to [Root.GetName] in warfare.\nIt is said that whoever can march through all of Ireland undefeated is the true High King... and [From.GetName] may not merit such a boast."

The ancient privileges of the High King still prevail in the hearts and minds of our people, so we cannot afford to refuse his demands, but we await the day this crooked pretender's power wanes and a more fair High King can be installed!"

While simple pilgrims are content with coins, ampoules or small bells, many of the Crusaders wear necklaces with Christian symbols under their armour as they march to the Holy Land, spurring them on to fight for their faith."
 vn_prices.4.a: "This will increase the demand for tin."
 vn_prices.5.t: "Tin Tableware"
 vn_prices.5.d: "From the increase of the prosperity in the trading cities of Europe, the new pewter dishes came to high reputation. Slowly it displaced wooden tableware from the cities and spread to the countryside. The material is also ideal for other household items like candle holders, making it impossible to imagine living without it."
 vn_prices.5.a: "Tin has become a cheap substitute for other metals."
 vn_prices.6.t: "Caribbean Pearls"
 vn_prices.6.d: "After the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, the Isla de Margarita and Isla de Cubagua were among the first places in the New World to be seized and colonized by the Europeans. The production of pearls from the coastal pearl beds quickly began here, and Caribbean pearls were exported to Europe as a result. Many kings and queens of Europe began to crave these exotic and luxurious objects in order to increase their prestige and wealth."
 vn_prices.6.a: "This will decrease the demand for European pearls."
 vn_prices.7.t: "Monastery Brewery"
 vn_prices.7.d: "During Lent, monks were forced to bow to hard rules that allowed only a few dishes. In order to avoid malnutrition, many monasteries began brewing their own beers, as liquid food was not forbidden. In the newly founded monastery breweries, experimentation with various ingredients started, resulting in dozens of different local beers. The beer was quickly sold to the common people, where it developed into one of the most popular folk drinks."
 vn_prices.7.a: "This will increase the demand for beer."
 vn_prices.8.t: "Waldensians in Germany"
 vn_prices.8.d: "Expelled from their homeland by the horrors of the Thirty Years' War, many Waldensians fled to Germany, where they looked for tolerant counts and dukes in whose domains they were allowed to settle. There they began to drain swamps and cultivate the land, growing potatoes that had been unknown to the locals until then. Although it would take quite a long time before this tuber developed into an inexpensive staple food, it should not only protect the Germans from starvation and famine several times."
 vn_prices.8.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.9.t: "Summa Lacticiniorum"
 vn_prices.9.d: "Cheese production in Europe has a long tradition, which is why today hundreds of local cheese dairies compete for the best of all cheeses. Pantaleone da Confienza, an expert in dairy products from Savoy, has therefore written an extensive book called 'Summa lacticiniorum', in which he demonstrates his knowledge of regional cheeses and cheese production."
 vn_prices.9.a: "How can you govern a country in which there are 246 kinds of cheese?"
 vn_prices.10.t: "Knight Horse Breeding"
 vn_prices.10.d: "With the emergence of the knighthood, the importance of the horse in chivalric warfare and culture has increased. Many horse breeders are now competing for the best generation of warhorses to help local knights to win battles and tournaments."
 vn_prices.10.a: "This will increase the demand for horses."
 vn_prices.11.t: "Siemens-Martin Process"
 vn_prices.11.d: "With the invention of the Open Hearth Furnace, that was able to maintain constant temperatures above the melting temperature of steel thanks to its special design, significant progress was made in steel production. Although it was possible to process scrap into steel, the steel produced with it was known for its above-average quality, as nitrogen could be prevented from dissolving in the steel."
 vn_prices.11.a: "Excellent."
 vn_prices.12.t: "Syphilis Outbreak"
 vn_prices.12.d: "On their journey back home, Portuguese and Spanish explorers brought not only exotic goods but also diseases from the natives of the New World to Europe, which developed into a severe Syphilis epidemic in the 16th century. Luckily, doctors were able to quickly find a way to cure it: ointments made of mercury."
 vn_prices.12.a: "This will increase the demand for mercury."
 vn_prices.13.t: "Afterpains of the Black Death"
 vn_prices.13.d: "The Black Death is raging in Europe and ravaging millions of people, whether peasants or nobles. Many regions are left behind depopulated, leaving fields uncultivated. As a result, food production is suffering, leading to famine and even more poor people dying."
 vn_prices.13.a: "Terrible times!"
 vn_prices.14.t: "Arab Agricultural Revolution"
 vn_prices.14.d: "Agriculture in the Near East has always proved difficult due to a lack of freshwater, which confronts farmers with new challenges time and again. Therefore, various agronomists from far and wide have developed new methods in farming, irrigation systems and livestock breeding as well as new equipment like ploughs to facilitate agriculture and increase agricultural yields."
 vn_prices.14.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.15.t: "Renaissance Architecture"
 vn_prices.15.d: "With the start of the Renaissance, the decline of medieval architecture began, leading to the emergence of new, modern styles. Inspired by the constructions of the Romans and Greeks, the newly erected churches and palaces were increasingly covered or decorated with marble. Many cities in Italy and Greece became wealthy and respected through the mining of marble."
 vn_prices.15.a: "This will increase the demand for marble."
 vn_prices.16.t: "Dried Fruits"
 vn_prices.16.d: "In Mesopotamia, the conservation of fruit by drying has been practiced since thousands of years, where it was considered a vitamin-rich and healthy diet. Only after the expansion of the Ottoman Empire to Southeast Europe did dried fruit spread through Anatolia and Greece to Western Europe, where people slowly began to dry fruits such as grapes or figs themselves."
 vn_prices.16.a: "This will increase the demand for fruits."
 vn_prices.17.t: "Invention Of Spectacles"
 vn_prices.17.d: "The invention of spectacles by an Italian monk in the late 13th century revolutionized work in monastic scriptoria. With the help of convex lenses, far-sighted monks were able to detect and read even the smallest letters, helping them to write and copy theological writings."
 vn_prices.17.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.18.t: "Gingerbread Bakeries"
 vn_prices.18.d: "Originally baked by monks and nuns, gingerbread was a durable meal until the 13th century, which was mainly kept for bad times. Later organized in guilds, gingerbread bakers began began to refine the recipe and experiment on it, conceiving regional gingerbread specialties. As time went on, many German cities created their own gingerbread recipes, making it a popular treat at medieval European festivals and fairs."
 vn_prices.18.a: "This will increase the demand for honey."
 vn_prices.19.t: "European Carpet Weaving"
 vn_prices.19.d: "With the improvement of handmade textile manufacturing, many carpet weavers began to open in large French, English and Dutch cities. In terms of technique and style, they were inspired by oriental carpets, which had enjoyed great prestige until then thanks to their immaculate quality. For this reason, it was no longer necessary to rely on expensive imports from Persia or North Africa, but instead to buy local carpets that resembled the original ones."
 vn_prices.19.a: "This will decrease the demand for carpets."
 vn_prices.20.t: "Irish Whiskey"
 vn_prices.20.d: "The English knight Sir Thomas Phillips was granted the royal right to distill whiskey in 1608, which led to the founding of Ireland's first distillery. The demand for whiskey increased dramatically in the following years, causing the Irish distilleries to focus on quantity, which resulted in poorer quality but enormous production."
 vn_prices.20.a: "This will increase the demand for spirits."
 vn_prices.21.t: "Fishery Breakthroughs"
 vn_prices.21.d: "Since the High Middle Ages, small and agile sailing ships have been used for fishing. Only through later advancements of the construction, proper fishing fleets were created, consisting of hundreds of fishing boats. These were able to endure for weeks on the high seas, often the caught fish were transferred to trading ships, which returned to the coast, while the fishing boats continued fishing. Thus, with only three or four such voyages at sea per year, enough fish could be harvested to cover any demand for fish."
 vn_prices.21.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.22.t: "Spirits cure the Black Death?"
 vn_prices.22.d: "Millions of people are infected with the Black Death and plague doctors are desperately trying to fight the disease. Without a universal remedy, they often have only the use of dubious healing methods, often influenced by superstition. Nevertheless, various spirits have been used to disinfect wounds and alleviate pain, making them part of the basic equipment of doctors."
 vn_prices.22.a: "This will increase the demand for spirits."
 vn_prices.23.t: "Shipyards And Ropemakers"
 vn_prices.23.d: "With the colonization of the Americas, the construction of gigantic high sea fleets began in order to create trade routes between the Old and New World, to transport goods and people, and to defend them against pirates and rivals. For this reason, new shipyards were built in many places, and the need for material for the construction and maintenance of ships increased significantly."
 vn_prices.23.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.24.t: "Widespread Deforestation"
 vn_prices.24.d: "Forests were an important habitat in the Middle Ages, not only because they provided wood and food, but also because many other economic sectors depended on them. Due to the increasing population, extensive deforestation often took place in order to create new areas for settlement and grazing. As a result, forests were uncontrollably overexploited, leading in many places to a shortage of timber or firewood, followed by much too late regulations by feudal lords."
 vn_prices.24.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.25.t: "Intensification of Sahara Trade"
 vn_prices.25.d: "With the foundation of the Kingdom of Mali, a period of peace and prosperity began in the sub-Saharan Empire. The sale of gold and salt to the Maghreb states led to a gigantic economic boom in both regions, opening up additional trade routes through the Sahara Desert."
 vn_prices.25.a: "This will increase the demand for camels."
 vn_prices.26.t: "Finer Soap Manufactories"
 vn_prices.26.d: "With the end of the Black Death in Europe, people began to believe that bathing alone could prevent diseases, so that in many places public bathhouses were opened, which usually caused the opposite of what had been expected due to a lack of hygiene standards however. Nevertheless, soap developed into a cheap hygienic article, which was produced since the 15th century in manufactories using vegetable oils, occasionally supplying entire kingdoms."
 vn_prices.26.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.27.t: "Smoked Meat"
 vn_prices.27.d: "Crop failures, famines and harsh winters often made it difficult for the common people to survive in the Middle Ages. The invention of the chimney did not only improve heating systems but also allowed people to preserve excess meat with the addition of salt and thus save it for times of shortage."
 vn_prices.27.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.28.t: "Spread of Rice"
 vn_prices.28.d: "Rice was brought by the Moors to Iberia and Sicily, which has been an unknown food for the Christian world for centuries.

 vn_prices.28.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.29.t: "Tobacco Smoking"
 vn_prices.29.d: "Even before the Europeans arrived in North America, tobacco smoking was widespread among almost all indigenous tribes, using pipes made of wood, ceramics or natural materials. The Europeans adopted this tradition and began to produce clay and metal pipes. In addition to opium and hemp, tobacco was gaining increasing popularity not only as a remedy but also as a consciousness-expanding drug."
 vn_prices.29.a: "This will increase the demand for inhalants."
 vn_prices.30.t: "Colossuses Of Steel"
 vn_prices.30.d: "For centuries, wood was used to build boats and ships, but with industrialization spreading, shipbuilding also changed. Ships made of wood were not resistant to the new explosive weapons such as paixhans guns, allowing them to be sunk with very little bombardment. Therefore, the construction of more robust iron and later steel ships began, which were initially driven by sails, but later reached tremendous speeds thanks to steam engines."
 vn_prices.30.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.31.t: "Spread of Maize"
 vn_prices.31.d: "Maize has always been a traditional food of the Native Americans and was brought to Europe by Spanish explorers around 1500. Thanks to its ability to grow in diverse climates and to be harvested in successive years in the same field, this easy-to-grow crop spread rapidly across the continent. By the 18th century, maize has become the staple food for most peasants in Western Europe."
 vn_prices.31.a: "Ok."
 vn_prices.31.tt: "Provinces producing §YGrain§! or §YBarley§! have a chance to switch to §YCorn§! production for the following §Y100§! years."
 vn_prices.3100.d: "As the exploration of the New World is progressing, maize, originally unknown in Europe, is spreading rapidly on the continent. The [Root.GetTradeGoodsName] farmers of [Root.GetName] have heard of this wondrous plant and have begun to successfully and profitably switch their farming to maize cultivation."

 vn_religious_events.122.d: "In our libraries, more and more writings have appeared which the clergy have clearly designated as heretical. They demand that their books and records will be destroyed and the writers severely punished. However, we could take advantage of this situation to extort some money from the authors and let them get away with it."

 vn_religious_events.123.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has received a flattering nickname among the common people through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] benevolent, meek and just rule: [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of Light. Without a doubt, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is one of the most competent rulers that [Root.GetName] has ever ruled!"
 vn_religious_events.123.a: "Fabulous"
 vn_religious_events.124.t: "Apostate Coreligionists"
 vn_religious_events.124.d: "The authority of our religion is weakened, which is why it is no wonder that some not so faithful followers abandon the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Some of them have created sects or even joined infidel religions."
 vn_religious_events.124.a: "Heretic!"
 vn_religious_events.125.t: "Interfaithful Relations"
 vn_religious_events.125.d: "There are people who claim that we are just a heresy of one of the other great religious communities. While we may share religious principles with Christians, Jews and Muslims, we set ourselves apart from them by unique characteristics and can insist on an independent faith. We can use this situation to our advantage by easily maintaining friendly relationships with our putative brothers in faith."
 vn_religious_events.125.a: "Wonderful"
 vn_religious_events.126.t: "Satanistic Secret Cult"
 vn_religious_events.126.d: "Rumors are spreading at the court of [Root.GetName]. It is said that a secret religious cult that worships the Lord of Evil himself would have existed for some time in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. We must not tolerate such blasphemy and Satanism!"

 vn_religious_events.127.t: "Syncretism Unpopular"
 vn_religious_events.127.d: "Our religion and culture have always been strongly influenced by surrounding peoples, whose influences are still an integral part of our nation today. Many of our subjects have begun to understand this syncretism as assimilation, fearing that the remaining [Root.Culture.GetName] traditions will sooner or later disappear completely."
 vn_religious_events.127.a: "Terrible"
 vn_religious_events.128.t: "Education of [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 vn_religious_events.128.d: "Our [Root.Heir.GetTitle] is still young and has a lot to learn in order to become a good ruler later on. Our advisors suggest hiring one of the best scholars in the country to teach [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] a pious and wise life in the years to come. That would be an expensive measure, but it would pay off in the end."

 vn_religious_events.129.d: "Throughout the year, we celebrate many religious and cultural festivals that are firmly anchored in the traditions of our nation.

 vn_religious_events.131.d: "We have discovered that some of the royal court is involved in a conspiracy, including family members of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], dignitaries, and army officers.

 vn_religious_events.132.a: "Damn!"
 vn_religious_events.133.t: "Trade Expedition"
 vn_religious_events.133.d: "Once the trade relations of the ancient Egyptians extended over the entire Mediterranean Sea, resulting in extreme prosperity. We should also consider financing a trade expedition to persuade foreign rulers to intensify trade with our nation and thus increase our number of trade routes. Shall we do that?"

 vn_religious_events.134.d: "One of the most influential aristocratic families, who had been loyal to the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty for generations, turned against the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to overthrow [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].

 vn_religious_events.135.t: "Cat Plague"
 vn_religious_events.135.d: "Recently, the number of orphaned street cats and kittens in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has increased dramatically.

However, if we give short shrift of the cats, we will commit a crime against the will of the cat goddess Bastet."

 vn_religious_events.137.t: "Construction of a New Pyramid?"
 vn_religious_events.137.d: "The millennia-old pyramids of ancient Egypt are still today among the most magnificent buildings in the Old World; the largest of them reaches a height of almost 150 meters. With modern techniques and the most talented architects, we will certainly be able to erect an even greater pyramid, which, once completed, will preserve the prestige of our nation and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for all eternity."

 vn_religious_events.139.t: "Revival of Hieroglyphs?"
 vn_religious_events.139.d: "Preserved inscriptions and buildings of the ancient Egyptians are still hiding great secrets that can only be unlocked by decoding hieroglyphs. Maybe we should not just focus on deciphering these ancient symbols, but also actively accept, promote and develop them."
 vn_religious_events.139.a: "True Egyptians use hieroglyphics of course"
 vn_religious_events.139.b: "We do not need such moss-grown stuff"
 vn_religious_events.140.t: "Reliable Harvest Prediction"
 vn_religious_events.140.d: "We have been generous to the Gods this year and according to the predictions of our oracles Renenutet will bestow a rich harvest on us this season. Our farmers are already preparing to harvest the vast amounts of the precious crops."
 vn_religious_events.140.a: "Wonderful"

 vn_religious_events.153.d: "The trio of so-called 'Cappadocian Fathers', consisting of Saint Basil of Caesarea, Saint Gregory of Nyssa, and Saint Gregory of Nazianzus, is considered to constitute the greatest of early Byzantine theologians. In the fourth century, the three Saints were crucial in developing Orthodox trinitarian doctrines in the face of various anti-trinitarian heresies.\nNow that we have recovered the cities for which each respective Saint served as Bishop, we can restore their tombs and honor their legacies once again."

 vn_religious_events.2.t: "Emptying of a Church"
 vn_religious_events.2.d: "Our clergy is permanently engaged in transforming former Catholic churches into [Root.Religion.GetName] churches for use in our worship services. Before that, however, any religious statues, portraits and icons will be removed and possibly replaced.\nAfter days of work, a former cathedral was completely emptied with the help of day labourers. Now the question arises what should happen to all the useless gold and silver that has been collected."

 vn_religious_events.21.t: "An Ambitious General"
 vn_religious_events.21.d: "A young but talented man who sees himself as a 'Warrior of God' has attracted the attention of our officers. He has assembled a few dozen armed men from his homeland, with whom he leads some kind of religious army within our borders, fighting heretics. By opposing the despicable clergy, he gains more and more approval among the common people day by day. Although he has never had any military education, our nobility proposes to accept this man into our army to command our own troops."
 vn_religious_events.21.a: "Excellent idea"
 vn_religious_events.21.b: "Better not"
 vn_religious_events.22.t: "Religious Massacre"
 vn_religious_events.22.d: "Religious militarism increasingly leads to violent tensions between different religious members among our subjects. This propensity to violence and dissension has unloaded into a bloody massacre in which hundreds of people of the religious minorities were brutally killed and executed by Hussites. This must not become a habit."

 vn_religious_events.23.t: "Pillage of a Monastery"
 vn_religious_events.23.d: "A large number of peasants revolted against the religious institutions and began to plunder and burn down dozens of churches and monasteries. The Church now fears peasant uprisings in other regions as well, which is why it urges us to suppress these revolts."

 vn_religious_events.25.t: "The Day of the Lord is coming?"
 vn_religious_events.25.d: "Our people are in a state of turmoil! A popular preacher and theologian claimed in one of his recent services that the Apocalypse would break over [Root.GetName] in just a few days. There are many people in the realm who have sunk into hours of praying to praise God one last time and are eagerly awaiting the Last Judgement. Everyone, even high [Root.GetAdjective] statesmen, wants to prove their piety before facing God."
 vn_religious_events.25.a: "The End is Nigh!"
 vn_religious_events.25.b: "That is nonsense!"
 vn_religious_events.26.t: "Foundation of Religious Settlements"
 vn_religious_events.26.d: "Many devout and fanatical Hussites have left their homes in major cities to get rid of secular burdens. They flock to the countryside, where they found new villages and towns, establishing their own parishes and living according to their own principles. Thanks to these people, previously undeveloped regions in [Root.GetName] are now tapped and cultivated."
 vn_religious_events.26.a: "Very well"
 vn_religious_events.27.t: "Sermon on the Mount"
 vn_religious_events.27.d: "A popular Hussite preacher is much appreciated by the common people. To offer him a larger audience, a Sermon on the Mount is held near [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] in which he can prove his silver tongue in front of thousands of faithful people."

 vn_religious_events.28.t: "Large Weapon Resignation"
 vn_religious_events.28.d: "Many people in [Root.GetName] are tired of waging our wars that kill their families and devastate their homes. Encouraged by our preachers, experienced soldiers as well as common peasants have laid down their weapons. It will take time to persuade them to fight again."

 vn_religious_events.29.b: "Punish the culprits"
 vn_religious_events.3.t: "Curia Scandal"
 vn_religious_events.3.d: "A scandalous incident at the Holy See has shaken the Catholic world.

Although there is no hope for that, it strengthens our religion."
 vn_religious_events.3.a: "Very well"
 vn_religious_events.30.t: "Growing Opposition to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 vn_religious_events.30.d: "A group of influential nobles, suspiciously envious of the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] since [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] coronation, has been operating against our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for some time. They spread lies about [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and unjustifiably question [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] legitimacy. They have now set up a commission with which they try to disempower [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] in order to take control of [Root.GetName] themselves. We must get rid of these enemies."

 vn_religious_events.31.t: "Non Vi Sed Verbo"
 vn_religious_events.31.d: "The followers of our faith propagate a strictly peaceful coexistence with our neighbors, which is why they regard armed conflicts with envy.

 vn_religious_events.31.b: "Sometimes war is necessary"
 vn_religious_events.32.t: "Disregard of Secular Rule"
 vn_religious_events.32.d: "A radical group of fanatical Anabaptists denies any secular power in our realm. They have refused their loyalty to local noble and clerical feudal lords. Our advisors fear that we will soon lose their loyalty to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] if we leave them alone."

 vn_religious_events.36.t: "Anabaptist Martyrdom"
 vn_religious_events.36.d: "In many European countries, the Anabaptist faith is denounced as heresy, which means persecution and death for many of our fellow believers. We will never forget all those Anabaptists who are condemned and executed unjustly."
 vn_religious_events.36.a: "Interesting"
 vn_religious_events.37.t: "Theological Disputes"
 vn_religious_events.37.d: "Among our theologians and clerics, there has been fierce spiritual controversies because they are divided about certain principles of our religion.

 vn_religious_events.38.t: "King of the Last Days"
 vn_religious_events.38.d: "A controversial theatrical play was performed in our capital, which particularly upset our theologians and priests. According to them, it distorts the reality of our religion to the detriment, which is why they are demanding that this play is banned. Are we giving in or insisting on artistic freedom?"

 vn_religious_events.4.t: "Completed Bible Translation"
 vn_religious_events.4.d: "Our theologians have translated the Bible into a [Root.Culture.GetName] dialect because we are no longer bound by the prohibition of the Catholic Church, which actually forbids this. This will now allow more people to read and understand the Holy Scriptures."
 vn_religious_events.4.a: "Wonderful"
 vn_religious_events.40.t: "University Reforms"
 vn_religious_events.40.d: "For a long time, the Pope controlled most of our universities through strict laws and regulations, which were intended to prevent streams of reformatory thought. But thanks to our courageous detachment from Catholicism, all these problems have become obsolete. However, the question now is whether our clergy should continue to influence the educational institutions of our nation or whether we should aspire to public and independent universities."

 vn_religious_events.5.b: "Convert them"
 vn_religious_events.6.t: "Uncovered Money Smuggling"
 vn_religious_events.6.d: "We have learned that one of our monasteries was caught smuggling money. In the past, the local monks had already allowed themselves luxury from clandestine money, contrary to monastic rules. Such behavior is despicable and must not be tolerated. The Church now demands the lawful punishment of the involved smugglers and monks and the confiscation of their money."

 vn_religious_events.71.t: "Mithraism"
 vn_religious_events.71.d: "The Mithras Cult, whose roots lie in Zoroastrianism, exists as a religious cult in our realm and is widespread especially among our soldiers. Even if they worship the Iranian Sun God Mithras, it is worth considering to promote this cult."

 vn_religious_events.73.t: "Rebirth of Hellenic Philosophy"
 vn_religious_events.73.d: "The ancient Greeks are famous for the excellent philosophers they produced. Men like Aristotle or Plato are a great role model for many scholars today. Therefore, it is no wonder that more and more of our scholars are rediscovering and developing Hellenic philosophy."

 vn_religious_events.74.t: "[Root.GetAdjective] Epics"
 vn_religious_events.74.d: "Even today, ancient works such as Homer's Iliad or Odyssey are regarded as true masterpieces of literature that no one could ever surpass. With the revival of the Hellenic religion, many of our writers have started to imitate these great writers and dabble in writing such epics themselves.

In this system, the fourth sibling of the ruling [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would succeed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] death rather than [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own child, and in turn each other sibling would move one step up the 'ladder' of most prestigious principalities.\nWith the passing of our last monarch, we must now crown a successor from among our relatives - or ignore this ancient tradition and run the risk of incurring the wrath of our brethren."

Only now have representatives of the competing Popes made it to our state and asked which side we stand with. What should we tell them?"
 western_schism.6.a: "Avignon"
 western_schism.6.b: "Rome"
 western_schism.7.t: "Captivity Unrecognized"
 western_schism.7.d: "With the rise of popular theological movements across Europe, our continued claims over the Papacy are seen transparently by the citizenry of Europe, and no longer carry any clout. The Papacy has escaped from our grasp despite all our efforts."
 western_schism.7.a: "Unfortunate"
 western_schism.8.t: "Abandoning the Pope Altogether?"
 western_schism.8.d: "The dawn of the Protestant Reformation has changed the religious landscape of Europe significantly. In a previous century, we decided to abandon the false Popes of Rome and instead follow the true Papal line in Avignon. Now that the rest of Europe is following suit in abandoning their fealty to the Roman Pontiff, and there are so few followers of Avignon left in the world, should we join this new movement that eschews Papal authority altogether?"
 western_schism.8.a: "Adopt the Protestant faith"
 western_schism.8.b: "Adopt the Reformed faith"
 western_schism.8.c: "We must not apostatize!"
 western_schism.9.d: "The deep devotion of the Avignon Catholiques in Avignon has awakened a desire for an independent state ruled by Popes of the Church. A large part of the population has expressed support for the idea of such an establishment and has now turned to $MONARCH$ for approval."
 western_schism.9.b: "Avignon is rightfully theirs"
